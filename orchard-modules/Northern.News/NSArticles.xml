                &lt;p&gt;On September 7, 2011, the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Manufacturing Sector Council presented an award to the National Safety Council (NSC) for its exemplary contributions in turning research into practice that can prevent occupational injuries, illnesses, exposure to hazards, and fatalities in the manufacturing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The award was accepted by Jim Johnson, Vice President of Workplace Safety Initiatives at the National Safety Council and member of the NORA Manufacturing Sector Council, on behalf of the NSC. The award is part of the NORA National Manufacturing Agenda&amp;#39;s plans to lead a national campaign to move employers to identify and create partnerships that will improve occupational safety and health within manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The award was announced at the Partnerships to Improve Occupational Safety and Health conference, which took place on September 7 and 8, 2011 in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Created in 1996, NORA is a partnership program that works to develop better workplace practices through research, and has become a framework for standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Because many hazards may be present in manufacturing, wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; can significantly reduce the risk of injury at the workplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of jobs that pose a risk to your ability to breathe. Sanding, grinding, and sweeping different materials makes tiny particles fly into the air. It&amp;#39;s important to have the right &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; when you work in these kinds of environments.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the best choices when it comes to protecting your respiratory system is the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/150-20093/NS-Respiratory-7210-N95-Disposable-Particulate-Respirator"&gt;NS&amp;reg; 7210 N95 Disposable Particulate Respirator&lt;/a&gt;. It gives full coverage to the mouth and nose. The adjustable noseclip helps block heat and moisture from fogging goggles and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to see what you&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Disposable Particulate Respirator not only keeps you safe, but it&amp;#39;s also easy to wear. The padded nosepiece and soft inner shell material provides comfortable wear. Two elastic straps allow a secure fit. This respirator is one of many &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; that a workplace should have on-hand to promote the safety of its workers.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In 1996, Dallas, Texas, was a part of an international initiative to reduce injuries and save lives, and was certified as the first Safe Community by the World Health Organization (WHO). Now, in 2011, the city has renewed its certification, showing its commitment to the safety of the people of Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The push for safety was led by the Injury Prevention Center (IPC) of Greater Dallas, which worked hard to make strides in safety for the past 15 years. IPC developed Operation Installation, which installed 26,000 smoke alarms in homes and businesses, providing protection to more than 42,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because of our commitment to evaluation, we have been able to determine which strategies are producing the desired results and which ones are not,&amp;quot; said Shelli Stephens-Stidham, director of IPC. &amp;quot;The strategies being implemented are more effective, which continues to make Dallas a safer city.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dallas was awarded the certification based on certain indicators, which include programs that document the frequency and cause of&amp;nbsp;injuries, evaluation measures that check programs already in place, and creating long-term sustainable programs for all genders, ages, environments, and situations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Safe Communities America was developed to decrease the number of injuries at play, at work, and on roads, which is the fifth-leading cause of death in the country. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as fire extinguishers, should be available in all homes, businesses, and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On July 20, 2011, Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis made a statement regarding the extremely high temperatures that have swept across the country and how they can impact the health and safety of outdoor workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Four weeks into the summer, the nation continues to experience record heat. For outdoor workers, this means being at risk for heat-related illnesses, including heat exhaustion and heat stroke,&amp;quot; Solis said in a recent statement. She went on to outline precautions that outdoor workers need to follow in order to remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All outdoor workplaces should have a site plan to prevent heat-related illnesses, and they should be sure that medical services are readily available in the event of an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Solis also stated that water, rest, and shade are crucial to staying in good health when working outdoors. She advised employers to review guidelines set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which suggest that training should be provided to workers about the hazards that lead to heat stress, and at least one pint of water be drank every hour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt; to help workers deal with the heat include cooling clothing and bandanas, and disposable respirators with exhalation valves.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The earlier workers are prepared for cold weather, the better. Even with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as insulated, waterproof work boots, warm &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and protective clothing, cold weather can be dangerous. Here are some of the most common problems that workers in cold temperatures face, as well as basic first aid to perform while you wait for medical professionals to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frostbite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Symptoms of frostbite include tingling and stinging sensations that are quickly followed by numbness&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Frostbite can be identified by bluish or pale, waxy skin, which results from slowed blood flow&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The CDC recommends that frostbite victims be immediately moved indoors&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Affected body parts should be placed in warm (but not hot) water&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Massaging and rubbing frostbitten body parts is not recommended&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypothermia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; This condition results from the body&amp;#39;s temperature dropping so low that it can no longer regulate itself&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Symptoms include slow movement, confusion, and loss of coordination&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; According to the CDC, workers afflicted with hypothermia should be brought into a warm area immediately&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The torso of a person who is suffering from hypothermia should be warmed first, with blankets, clothes, or towels&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Warm beverages may help if the person is conscious&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The best defense for frostbite and hypothermia is to take frequent breaks from the cold. Employers should allow workers to step inside or get warm near a heat source before returning to work in cold-weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many workers are exposed to the sun for long periods throughout their workdays. The risk of over-exposure to ultraviolet light is high in these cases. UV rays cause sunburn, and in some cases may lead to skin cancer. Follow these tips to work efficiently and safely outside this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Whenever possible, work in the shade or beneath a screen&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Always use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and re-apply frequently throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Purchase new sunscreen each year&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Some insect repellents decrease the effectiveness of sunscreen, which means reapplications will need to be more frequent&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; that have a full brim to shade the ears and neck&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Wear sunglasses that offer 100 percent UV protection&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; When using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, select a model with a dark shade&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Wear loose-fitting clothing that allows moisture to evaporate&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Clothing that is darker in color and has a tight weave will block more of the sun&amp;#39;s rays&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; including cooling headwear, bandanas, vests, and towels&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Take frequent breaks out of direct sun and drink plenty of water&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On July 18, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had approved the influenza vaccine for the 2011-2012 flu season, allowing all six licensed manufacturers to produce and distribute it throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way to prevent contracting influenza, a contagious disease that affects the respiratory system and is caused by the influenza virus. The vaccination was produced to protect against the three strains of the virus that are expected be the most prevalent this year, including the same strains as the 2010-2011 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on average, 5 to 20 percent of the population contracts the disease and more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued guidance on how to minimize influenza spread in the workplace, which includes proper hygiene, the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, and staying home from work when ill.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FDA stresses the importance of receiving the vaccine, for personal prevention as well as for controlling the illness in places of work.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many types of jobs require the use of a ladder. When used incorrectly, step, straight, extension, and combination ladders can be dangerous. When wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, employees can reduce risks when ladders are involved. Ladder placement is very important and it&amp;#39;s a good idea to keep these guidelines in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; The spot where a ladder meets the object that it&amp;#39;s leaning against is its contact point&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; When using an extension or straight ladder, there should always be at least 3 feet between the ladder&amp;#39;s contact point and its top&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Never stand on the top three rungs of a straight, single, or extension ladder&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The horizontal distance between the bottom of the ladder and the contact point it&amp;#39;s resting on should be one-fourth of the vertical length&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Ladders should only be used on a level surface and should never touch anything but the ground or floor&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Boxes, step stools, and other items shouldn&amp;#39;t ever be used to give a ladder more height or reach&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; When using a stepladder or a ladder that extends, any locks that keep it upright need to be locked securely in place&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Check and re-check all locks before anyone climbs on a ladder&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Never use the top step or rung of a ladder as a step&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers should train workers on proper ladder use and any additional safeguards or procedures that may apply to their worksites or facilities to reduce the dangers of ladder use.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Some work, particularly on roads and other types of infrastructure, can only be done during periods of light use. This means that employees will often have to work late or show up for night shifts. There are a number of hazards that are unique to working at night or that result from spending extra time on the job. Employers should make sure that their workers are well-rested and ready to tackle a night shift.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks and meals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                The Department of Labor (DOL) estimates that it can take as many as 10 days for a person&amp;#39;s body to become accustomed to sleeping during the day and being awake all night. Even after becoming used to a reversed schedule, people can find themselves easily falling out of the cycle they need to maintain to work at night. As a result, it&amp;#39;s easy for workers to become fatigued earlier in a shift than they would during regular daytime hours.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to lunch or dinner times and regular breaks, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) suggests giving employees more frequent breaks to rest when working a night shift. The use of quick &amp;quot;micro&amp;quot; breaks to change positions, shift concentration, and move around a little should be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staffing and monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In addition to providing opportunities to rest, supervisors need to keep a close eye on workers at night and during extended hours. Whether they&amp;#39;re used to the schedule or not, employees can find themselves showing signs of fatigue. Symptoms to watch out for include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Irritability&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Lack of motivation&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Weariness&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Sleepiness&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Depression&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Lack of concentration&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Trouble with memory&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Giddiness&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Headaches&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Loss of appetite&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Should these symptoms be noticed, the employee should be evaluated and possibly relieved from his position and given a chance to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hazard exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Working long shifts often means that employees may be exposed to hazardous materials that exceed standards. Employers should monitor and limit exposure to maintain health standards. This can be accomplished by limiting the time that employees remain at a worksite, providing clean locations for resting, and placing break areas well upwind from contaminated worksites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, all projects could be completed on time during normal work hours. Unfortunately, projects can exceed their budgets for time and resources, and employers must call upon workers to put in overtime. Be sure to keep employees safe by offering frequent breaks, the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, supervision that checks for fatigue, and safe places to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many workplaces require &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; to protect against falling objects and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; to protect employees&amp;#39; hands from machinery and debris. They also require protection against something else that can be just as dangerous &amp;ndash; loud noise. Although hearing loss can occur suddenly, it usually happens gradually, over time, so it&amp;#39;s a good idea to take precautions against hearing loss whenever your job exposes you to loud sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA considers 85 decibels to be the loudest sustained noise that people can be exposed to without harming their ability to hear. Anything louder than that is a health risk and means that extra steps are necessary. One way to protect workers&amp;#39; hearing is to provide them with disposable or reusable &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, hearing band protectors, or ear muffs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Equipment and areas can be modified with engineering controls that include choosing lower noise tools and machinery, and enclosing or isolating the noise source. Barriers, such as sound walls or curtains, can be placed between workers and loud machinery and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Besides ear plugs, an effective remedy for noise exposure is to implement administrative changes in the workplace that can reduce that exposure. Those changes can include having workers stand farther away from loud equipment, limiting the time workers spend near a noise source, or operating loud equipment during shifts when fewer people are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Employees who work on and around scaffolding face several different hazards. These hazards include falls from heights, scaffold collapse, being struck by falling tools, and electrocution from power lines. Workers need to use the right &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; when doing jobs on scaffolds or even walking near them. All employees should be outfitted with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and workers on scaffolding with a minimum distance of 10 feet to the next level below should be equipped with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, such as harnesses and lanyards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are two basic types of scaffolding, including supported scaffolding that consist of rigid, load-bearing framework, and the suspended variety that includes ropes or other non-rigid overhead support. Manlifts and personnel hoists are sometimes thought of as vehicles or machinery, but can also be thought of as another type of supported scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Only a qualified person with a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or an individual with extensive knowledge, training, and experience should erect scaffolding. The qualified person will determine the type of scaffold necessary, the maximum load, and that the scaffolding has a good foundation. Concrete blocks, bricks, or debris should never be used to prop or tilt a section of scaffolding. During building or use, no one should ever climb on the scaffolding frame, and based on the type of scaffold, only ladders or stairwells should be used to access or exit scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to daily inspections of scaffolding, workers should receive training on the proper use of scaffolding and how to handle materials on scaffolding. Training should also include recognizing electrical, fall, and falling object hazards in the work area, and procedures to control and minimize them. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides some guidelines for the distance that scaffolding must be from power lines:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Insulated wires that carry less than 300 volts of electricity must kept at least 3 feet from scaffolding&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Insulated lines carrying between 300 volts and 50 kilovolts need to be at least 10 feet from scaffolding and if over 50 kilovolts, 0.4 inches needs to be added for every kilovolt over 50&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Uninsulated lines with less than 50 kilovolts should be 10 feet from all wires and if over 50 kilovolts, an additional 0.4 inches must be added for every kilovolt over 50&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In addition to daily inspections of scaffolding, workers should receive training on the proper use of scaffolding and how to handle materials on scaffolding. Training should also include recognizing electrical, fall, and falling object hazards in the work area, and procedures to control and minimize them.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If you work in power plants, factories, or other facilities that use electricity, you may be familiar with lockout/tagout procedures. What you might not know is that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that 120 deaths and 50,000 injuries are prevented every year because of proper compliance with lockout/tagout procedures. The average time to recuperate from these injuries is 24 workdays.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lockout and tagout devices keep power sources from being activated when they are being serviced. This is done by using either physical locks, group lockboxes, or warning tags, depending on the situation. Employees need to be familiar with their workplace&amp;#39;s regulations and procedures. They also need training to be able to operate these devices and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The rules surrounding &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security"&gt;lockout/tagout&lt;/a&gt; devices are strict because the risks are so high. To protect their workers, employers should develop, implement, and enforce an energy control program, and use only lockout/tagout devices authorized for the particular equipment or machinery and ensure that they are durable, standardized, and substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Power tools can be very dangerous, which is why it&amp;#39;s so important to know how to use them properly. The most important thing to remember is that workers need to be trained to use each tool that their job requires. This training should also include safe working procedures, potential hazards, and wearing the right &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and work boots.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the most common mistakes that people make with power tools involves their power cords. Tools should never be carried by the cord. It puts too much strain on the connection point, increasing the possibility of a malfunction. When disconnecting the cord from an outlet, the power tool should be turned off and the plug should be firmly grasped and pulled from the outlet. Plugs should never be removed from an outlet by yanking on the cord. Power tools should be turned off and disconnected from their power source whenever they&amp;#39;re not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Pneumatic tools are powered by a compressor that supplies compressed air. The greatest danger of pneumatic tools is getting hit by an attachment or a fastener being used with the tool. In addition to using safety clips or retainers on pneumatic tools, screens or shields are required to protect nearby workers from flying fragments around chippers, riveting guns, staplers, and air drills.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Damaged tools shouldn&amp;#39;t be used until they&amp;#39;re repaired. Setting aside a broken tool alone isn&amp;#39;t enough to deter other staff members who might not understand that it&amp;#39;s dangerous. When a tool is set aside for repair or service, it needs to be clearly tagged &amp;quot;Do Not Use&amp;quot; or locked away to prevent use and possible injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maintaining solid footing is very important for staying safe. Many power tool injuries come from workers slipping and falling while they&amp;#39;re using a drill, saw, or sander. Workers&amp;#39; feet should be firmly planted shoulder-width apart, and the floor or ground needs to be clear of debris to reduce trips and falls when using power tools.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Trenches can be dangerous worksites, but hazards associated with trench work are well-defined and preventable. There is no reliable warning when a trench fails, so they run the risk of suddenly collapsing, and it&amp;#39;s easy for objects to fall into them. Workers who spend a lot of time in trenches need to be extra careful and should take care to follow these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most important thing that workers need to know before they begin digging a trench is what&amp;#39;s underground. Gas lines, water pipes, and electrical wires are often buried, so supervisors and managers need to check with the local government to make sure that digging won&amp;#39;t cause a flood, explosion, or electrocution. A competent person, or one who the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines as being familiar with government regulations, can recognize hazards, and is authorized to correct them, needs to be on hand to judge the soil and landscape of an area before a trench is dug.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Any trench that is deeper than 5 feet needs to have supports in place, and any trench that is 20 feet deep or more is required by law to have supports that have been designed by an engineer. One of the easiest ways to do this is by sloping the walls of a trench down toward the bottom, giving support to the sides. Sometimes strong metal supports need to be installed to keep the walls up. This process is called shoring and is important to adhere to in very deep trenches.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Heavy equipment and spoil piles from the excavation should be kept at least 2 feet from the edge of the trench. During project planning, safe locations and heavy equipment routes should be mapped out to avoid cave-ins. Always wear the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; as an added precaution.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many jobs require people to perform tasks over and over again, five days a week, year after year. Hammering, typing, and lifting are all examples of things that can result in repetitive stress injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population. This applies to workstations, grips on power tools, boxes, and other devices that people often use for work. Some of the most important &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including back supports and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, are ergonomically designed, and jobs that require repetitive motions should always use the most comfortable equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers performing monotonous tasks should take frequent, short breaks. Consistent hammering, swinging, throwing, or lifting will eventually result in repetitive stress injury. Frequent breaks give muscles, bones, and tendons a chance to rest and will make repetitive stress injuries less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of activity, many repetitive motions can be reduced with training on proper tool use, redesigned work stations, and adding hand cut-outs to boxes. Even when using tools with ergonomic grips or extended triggers, vibration-dampening gloves will help reduce repetitive stress injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates workers in the healthcare industry sustain about 385,000 injuries related to sharp objects each year, and that up to one-third of these go unreported. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recently highlighted its STOP STICKS campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sharps, which include disposable syringes, suture needles, and winged needles, pose significant health dangers to a variety of healthcare workers including RNs, LPNs, and doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/stopsticks/" target="_blank"&gt;STOP STICKS campaign&lt;/a&gt; hopes to raise awareness and motivate healthcare workers to improve disposal procedures concerning sharps, and also to strengthen the safety culture among healthcare occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to training, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens standard requirements include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; may consist of protective clothing, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, respirators, gloves, and faceshields.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also taken steps to assure the proper disposal of sharps to keep waste workers safe from potential needle stick injuries, which can lead to infection. Measures implemented by the EPA include drop boxes and supervised collections sites, mail back programs, syringe exchange programs, and destruction devices designed for at-home disposal of sharps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security"&gt;lockout/tagout&lt;/a&gt; system is an important type of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;. Power sources and machines can be very dangerous if they are started while someone is working on them. They need to be completely shut down before workers can begin servicing them. A group lockout/tagout system uses keys to make sure that power sources and equipment are shut down and won&amp;#39;t reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Group lockout boxes are used for multiple workers and keys to single or multiple lockout devices. Keys to lockout devices or equipment disconnect master keys are placed in the group lockout box. Each worker on the crew then places his own personal lock on the box. As each worker&amp;#39;s task is completed, he removes his personal lock. When all locks have been removed, an authorized crew leader or supervisor verifies all workers are out of danger before reactivating power supplies or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Accident prevention tags are used with lockout devices to document the time, date, and contact information regarding each device locked out with the group lockout box. Tag messages include &amp;quot;danger &amp;ndash; do not operate,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;do not start,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hands off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;You may think wearing disposable coveralls is just a simple way to stay clean, but it&amp;#39;s actually a way to keep you safe. In some applications, such as removing asbestos or lead paint, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) requires workers to wear them to prevent illness and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many worker&amp;#39;s jobs involve working with hazardous materials. Asbestos, lead, paint, mold, and silica can all harm employees. These coveralls will protect against them, even after the material has been abraded. Employers should make &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/135-24162/DuPont-Tyvek-Standard-Disposable-Coveralls"&gt;DuPont&amp;trade; Tyvek&amp;reg; Standard Disposable Coveralls&lt;/a&gt; available to their workers. Protective clothing made from Tyvek&amp;reg; provides inherent barrier protection against the passage and entrapment of harmful dry particulates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These DuPont&amp;trade; Tyvek&amp;reg; coveralls offer greater roominess in the torso. The elastic waistband provides a more comfortable fit and greater range of motion. An extended zipper also makes them very easy to put on and take off.These disposable coveralls are an economical and convenient way to reduce contamination while keeping your workers comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), of the U.S. Department of Labor, released an update on Jul 27, 2011, which reported on the midyear summary of mining deaths throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As of June, there have been eight coal mining deaths and six fatalities of workers in the metal and nonmetal mining industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even though the number of mining deaths for the first half of this year are at an all-time low, one mining death is still one too many,&amp;quot; Joseph A. Main, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health, said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Main added that fatalities were not an &amp;quot;inevitable&amp;quot; aspect of mining, and that effective health and safety programs, training of miners, and proper workplace examinations can help miners identify and eliminate mining hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;MSHA provides miners, operators, and trainers with information on actions that should be taken for better safety, which include avoiding &amp;quot;red zones,&amp;quot; performing pre-shift and onshift examinations, and always wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We want all miners to go home safe and healthy at the end of each shift,&amp;quot; Main concluded. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A survey released by Kimberly-Clarke Professional on July 27, 2011, found that 89 percent of participating safety professionals admit to having seen workers not wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that are required on the job. Twenty nine percent claimed workers failed to wear personal protection equipment (PPE) that is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on &amp;quot;numerous occasions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The high rate of noncompliance with current protocols poses a major threat to worker health and safety, according to Gina Tsiropoulos, marketing manager for Kimber-Clarke Professional.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While the reasons for noncompliance are varied, the threat to workers is clear-cut. Without the proper use of PPE, they are at risk of serious injury or even death.&amp;quot; she said in a recent statement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sixty nine percent of respondents to the survey stated that workers failed to wear the equipment because they thought it wasn&amp;#39;t needed. Other reasons that followed included it being uncomfortable, too hot, ill-fitting, and unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Strategies to improve compliance were proposed after the findings, which included purchasing more comfortable and stylish PPE, associating compliance with individual performance evaluations, and developing incentive programs for wearing PPE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New research done by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) suggests that in order for workplaces to fully take advantage of wellness programs, they must be properly integrated with existing safety and health initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report states that employers have a tendency to approach safety and health protection programs and workplace wellness programs as two separate items, isolating them and allowing for zero interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Authors with ACOEM argue that for either activity to be truly effective, each much be integrated into a single &amp;quot;workplace health protection and promotion&amp;quot; system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ACOEM states that &amp;quot;health protection&amp;quot; includes the &amp;quot;activities that protect workers from occupational injury and illness,&amp;quot; which includes wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, while &amp;quot;health promotion&amp;quot; refers more to &amp;quot;activities that maintain or improve the personal health of a workforce.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By combining these two aspects of workplace safety effectively, employers can &amp;quot;increase their impact on overall health and productivity. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ACOEM is comprised of more than 5,000 occupational physicians and other health care professionals that provide leadership to promote optimal health and safety of workers, workplaces, and environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As one of the most important kinds of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, workers should be very familiar with their &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;. These items protect what is perhaps the most important part of the human body - the head. Different kinds of tasks and situations call for different kinds of hard hats, so it&amp;#39;s important to know the difference between the ANSI-defined classes and available hard hats.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type I and Type II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                All hard hats can be divided into two types - Type I and Type II. Type I hard hats are only designed to protect workers from objects and blows that come from above and strike the top of a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Type II hard hats are designed to offer protection from lateral blows and objects. This includes from the front, back, and side as well as from the top. Type II hard hats are also tested for off-center penetration resistance and chin strap retention.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Hard hats are also divided into classes that indicate how well they protect against electrical shock.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Class E (Electrical) hard hats can withstand up to 20,000 volts of electricity&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Class G (General) hard hats are able to withstand 2,200 volts of electricity&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Class C (Conductive) hard hats offer no protection from electric shock&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material &amp;amp; Suspensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Most hard hats are made of non-conductive, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and come equipped with a suspension that can be adjusted for a custom fit. Suspensions are available with 4, 6, or 8 load-bearing points and can be fitted using several different types of adjustments. The most common are pinlock, where the hard hat is removed and a pin is matched to a corresponding hole, and ratchet, which uses a knob to tighten or loosen the suspension&amp;#39;s fit around the head while wearing the hard hat.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When considering tasks and situations, hard hats are available in different styles. Cap hard hats have a short front brim that helps to shade the face from the sun and keeps rain away from the eyes. Some cap hard hats can also be worn backwards so the front brim is over the back of the neck. Full brim styles feature a brim that goes around the entire cap and shades the face, back of the neck, and ears. The full brim can also help to channel rain and snow away from the face and head.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Poison ivy is one of the most common allergies in the United States - it is believed that only 15 percent of people are immune to it. Workers who spend a lot of time outside need to know how to protect themselves against it. The United States Forest Service reports that about 10 percent of its lost time is due to poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Poison ivy is most common throughout North America and especially east of the Rocky Mountains. It has a characteristic three-leaf pattern of growth and can appear as a shrub or a vine. Workers should look for the leaves of three, hairy vines growing on trees and white berries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Poison oak is most common west of the Rockies and looks quite a bit like poison ivy. The difference is that the leaves of this plant are ridged or lobed and are similar in appearance to oak leaves. Poison sumac has thin, narrow leaves in sets of seven to 13 but is far less common than poison ivy or oak.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The best way for workers to protect themselves against these plants is by being vigilant. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/outdoor-exposure/outdoor-exposure-skin-care/outdoor-itch-relief-prevention"&gt;Outdoor itch relief and prevention products&lt;/a&gt; can also help. Supervisors and other workers should show new staff members how to spot the dangerous plants. If contact is made, most commercial-grade soap will remove the urushiol that causes the characteristic rash and blisters. It is important to use cold water to remove the oil, as hot water can open your pores and let the oils in faster.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are some creams and oils that can act as a barrier, capable of preventing the oil from affecting the skin if they&amp;#39;re applied before a worker touches the plant. Cleansers are also available that can help remove the toxic oil before the rash develops if used soon enough after touching these plants.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When contact is made with poison ivy, oak, or sumac, the affected areas should be washed and any clothes that might carry the oil need to be cleaned thoroughly as well. The oil can linger for years on objects that have not been properly washed, so it is important to be thorough with any materials that came into contact with the plants.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once the affected skin has been cleaned of the plants oils, the rash or blisters are not a contagious condition. Even if a worker has the characteristic reaction due to touching the plants, the only way to spread that reaction from person to person is if there are still plant oils on skin or clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a term that, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), describes situations when workers experience acute health and comfort effects that appear to be caused by time spent in a building, but no specific cause or illness can be found. Indicators of SBS can include symptoms that range from fatigue to eye, nose, and throat irritation. The cause of the symptoms is not known and relief generally occurs soon after leaving the building.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are many causes of SBS, such as poor air circulation and ventilation, but the main cause of SBS is the quality of air inside a building, which can cause occupational asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Occupational asthma comprises 15 percent of all cases of asthma that occur in adults, making it the most common work-related lung disease in the world. It is caused by substances known as asthmagens, and 200 have been identified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to prevent occupational asthma, workplace assessments must be taken to identify asthmagens in a potential work site. Other measures include employers, employees, and workplace health and safety officials deciding on appropriate strategies to minimize or eliminate exposure, such as installing better ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an estimated 11 million workers in a wide range of industries and jobs are exposed to at least one of the agents associated with occupational asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also important for employers to control irritating dust and particulates in the air from products, a manufacturing process, or sweeping. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt; that may be required include dust masks or respirators, and disposable coveralls. A well equipped first aid room, including a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; and other first aid supplies, should be available to workers in the event of illness or an asthma attack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to remember when selecting &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; is that there are many different kinds to choose from, but there is one type that is appropriate for a variety of jobs or tasks. When you&amp;#39;ve got maintenance, material handling, farming work, or other tasks to do, you&amp;#39;ll want to use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/126-4958/NS-Hand-Protection-Economy-Weight-Brown-Jersey-Work-Gloves-Standard-Size"&gt;NS&amp;reg; Economy Weight Standard Size Brown Jersey Work Gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;100 percent cotton gloves are great for providing reliable hand protection while maintaining dexterity. Workers also appreciate the clute cut pattern that ensures comfortable wear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These gloves also give workers protection for their wrists with knitwrist cuffs to keep debris out so that work continues without frequent stops to empty out gloves. Jersey Work Gloves are lightweight and can be worn for work indoors and outside. Standard size gloves fit most employees comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When working at a construction site, it&amp;#39;s important to keep vehicles and pedestrians out of the area and away from hazards and your workers. Equipping your worksite with rugged, all-weather &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/225-7075/Heavy-Duty-28-Traffic-Safety-Cone-with-4-6-Reflective-Collars-8-lb"&gt;Heavy-Duty 28&amp;quot; Traffic Safety Cones with 4&amp;quot; &amp;amp; 6&amp;quot; Reflective Collars&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent way to put up a protective barrier that keeps people safe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Heavy-duty traffic safety cones are one of the most important types of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; for worksites. They can create space around the shoulder of a road, traffic lane, or any work area that may be dangerous. In the daytime, their bright orange color is immediately seen by drivers. At night, their two rows of reflective collars reflect headlights back to motorists to signal that they should slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The cones feature a heavy black base and weigh 8 pounds, which makes them light enough to be easily moved when a worksite changes locations and heavy enough to remain stable in winds. They meet the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) safety requirements, so supervisors can rest easy knowing that they&amp;#39;ve provided the best level of protection for their workers and others.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Eyes are very sensitive, and in many workplaces, they need protection. When conditions require clear lenses, supervisors and managers should give their workers &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/100-30287/3M-Virtua-Safety-Glasses-with-Clear-Lens-Clear-Frame"&gt;3M Virtua&amp;trade; Safety Glasses with Clear Lens &amp;amp; Clear Frame&lt;/a&gt;.

                &lt;p&gt;When you work outside, it&amp;#39;s important to wear a safety vest so that you&amp;#39;re visible to drivers. Once you have a bright lime or orange vest in mind, it&amp;#39;s time to pick the right model. An excellent choice is the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/229-28080/NS-Traffic-Safety-Class-2-Deluxe-Mesh-Safety-Vest?skw=Class%202%20Deluxe%20Mesh%20Safety%20Vest"&gt;NS&amp;reg; Class 2 Deluxe Mesh Safety Vest&lt;/a&gt;. This vest is made from a breathable mesh material and provides a generous fit, which means workers will stay cooler in the hot summer sun.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The 3M Scotchlite&amp;trade; Reflective Material on the front and back will ensure excellent visibility for your workers, and the front zipper makes it easy for employees to quickly put on or take off the vest. The NS&amp;reg; Class 2 Vest also offers plenty of room for a company logo or special imprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This NS&amp;reg; Class 2 Deluxe Mesh Safety Vest also has some features that make it a good choice for a surveyor&amp;#39;s vest. There are eight pockets on the vest, which are perfect for holding pens, pencils, phones, and other important tools. The left shoulder has a communications clip for holding a walkie-talkie or any other kind of radio device. Perhaps most importantly, the NS&amp;reg; Class 2 Vest complies with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards and meets all Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Workers need to keep their hands in excellent condition when they perform heavy-duty work. Construction, agriculture, maintenance, and other labor-intensive jobs can cause blisters to develop on fingers and palms and can result in injuries. Employers should purchase &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/123-3100/NS-Hand-Protection-Standard-Leather-Palm-Work-Gloves-with-Safety-Cuff"&gt;NS&amp;reg; Standard Leather Palm Work Gloves with Safety Cuff&lt;/a&gt; - these gloves are an excellent way to provide workers with protection to help prevent these injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These gloves give employees a lot of finger mobility while providing them with a great deal of protection. They&amp;#39;re made from a combination of thick, durable leather and breathable, comfortable cotton. The gunn pattern, wing thumb, knuckle strap, and full-leather index finger and fingertips have been designed to protect the most vulnerable parts of the hand while allowing workers to operate machinery and use tools properly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The palms of these &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; are completely made of leather, which prevents blisters and abrasions. The palm lining inside the gloves is soft and keeps hands cool and comfortable. The back is elasticized for a better fit and maximum comfort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In addition to safety, one of the most important things that managers and supervisors want to consider when they select &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; is their workers&amp;#39; comfort. When workers are comfortable in products like &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, it can increase compliance with protective equipment regulations and make long hours and hard work seem easier.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers who want to make comfort as much of a priority as safety should offer their workers &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/110-30802/N-Specs-Tridon-Sport-Safety-Glasses-with-Clear-Lens"&gt;N-Specs&amp;reg; Tridon&amp;reg; Sport Safety Glasses with Clear Lens&lt;/a&gt;. These sporty safety glasses are constructed from transparent polycarbonate that ensures excellent impact protection, blocks harmful UV rays, and provide a wide field of vision with their wraparound design for increased safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Tridon&amp;reg; Sport Safety glasses also feature soft, rubber-coated temples. This keeps the glasses from slipping off of the face when heat or effort cause workers to sweat. A scratch-resistant coating makes these glasses an economical choice by allowing for longer use. Tridon&amp;reg; Sport glasses are manufactured in an ISO 9002 registered facility and comply with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many models of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; are available with clear lenses, but when a workplace is outdoors, glasses with a darker shade can provide more comfort and protection to workers. Whether it&amp;#39;s working on a road, operating heavy machinery, or engineering a waterway, the sun and the UV rays that it produces can be a hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Managers who select &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; for their outdoor workers will want to make &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/110-19696/N-Specs-Raptor-Safety-Glasses-with-Gray-Polycarbonate-Lens"&gt;N-Specs&amp;reg; Raptor&amp;reg; Safety Glasses with Gray Lenses&lt;/a&gt; available. Workers will appreciate the cool, modern look and the safety of a wraparound polycarbonate lens for impact protection and great peripheral vision.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The gray shade is excellent for blocking just enough of the sun&amp;#39;s rays to make work easier. Employees can keep UV rays and bright light from hurting their eyes while they are working, and the nylon frames mean that these safety glasses are lightweight and easy to wear for any kind of work. Employees will rest easy knowing that these glasses protect against impact and extreme bright light, and that they comply with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) assisted Georgia employers by hosting a heat illness prevention training session on August 3, 2011 in order to educate construction workers and employers about the dangers of working in extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The construction industry can be an uncomfortable place to work during the summer months, but it has also proven to be dangerous, as temperatures have soared in the last few years. Intense heat can cause heat stroke as well as acute heart, liver, kidney, and muscle damage. Workers suffering from heat stress are also at a greater risk for accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Workers die from heat-related stroke or illness every year, and every one of these deaths is preventable,&amp;quot; Cindy Coe, OSHA&amp;#39;s regional administrator in Atlanta, said in a statement. &amp;quot;We are glad that the construction industry recognizes the importance of this issue and is supporting OSHA&amp;#39;s heat illness prevention campaign.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the National Library of Medicine (NLM), heat-related emergencies can be easily prevented by taking frequent rest breaks and wearing loose-fitting clothing in hot weather.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to ensuring proper training about extreme heat conditions, employers should be sure that proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are being used at all times. When the sun contributes to the heat, using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; with a full brim to shade the ears and neck, wearing dark shade &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and providing cooling headwear, bandanas, vests, and towels will all help workers stay cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recently issued a statement outlining new threats found to be associated with mining and working around bodies of water.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;MSHA reports that since 2004, there have been 17 water-related deaths that have occurred in metal and non-metal mines, prompting them to assess the danger of water in mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alert states that the potential outcome of working around, over, or near water hazards may result in entrapment or drowning. The highest risks are associated with travel or equipment operation near a body of water, the weight and vibrations caused by large machinery, water banks being undercut, and the sloughing of the ground. Also included were precautions on the varying depth of water and swift currents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Outlined in the alert was a mining best practices sheet, which included conducting daily examinations of the workplace and becoming familiar with all aspects of a body of water, such as its depth and subsurface conditions. Keeping equipment away from the edge of a water source at all times was also listed as very important.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to personal flotation devices and rescue rings, employers should be sure that proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are being used at all times as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). These products may include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Following the Silvertip pipeline oil spill in Montana in July, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement addressing the health and safety of workers who are part of clean-up crews, and offered helpful resources on the best ways to handle oil spills.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Because oil spill clean-up efforts can be very dangerous, the CDC stated that workers and volunteers need to be aware of the hazards and risks involved and the proper safety precautions that need to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers may see hazards such as heat and cold stress, chemicals, and musculoskeletal hazards. The CDC responded by offering &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/montanaoilspillresponse/" target="_blank"&gt;online resources&lt;/a&gt; intended to help employers and workers prepare for oil-spill response activities, and to prevent work-related injuries and illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One way that workers can assess the risks involved in an oil spill clean-up is to contact the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which will run a health hazard evaluations program at no cost via phones and writing, or performed on-site.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC also states that &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are &amp;quot;very important for any emergency responder,&amp;quot; respirators, protective clothing, gloves, and eye protection are some of the most important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Not all airborne particulates that workers may come in contact with are necessarily toxic, but they can be irritating. The &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/150-20095/NS-Respiratory-7000-Dust-Mask?skw=7000%20Dust%20Mask"&gt;NS&amp;reg; 7000 Dust Mask&lt;/a&gt; is great for blocking dust, animal dander, grass clippings, pollen, sawdust, and other particulates that can be a nuisance when workers are trying to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Provide relief from dust and any other non-toxic airborne particulates by making the NS&amp;reg; 7000 Dust Mask available to your workers. The metal noseclip offers an easy adjustment for comfort and reduces eyewear fogging. Employees will be able to breathe easily through the lightweight design while preventing irritating, non-toxic dust from entering their mouth or nose.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dangerous jobs that involve toxic substances must always be done with the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and may require an air-purifying respirator for complete lung protection. These dust masks are a great way to be comfortable while sweeping, raking, sanding, and more. Designed specifically for comfort, this mask is easy to wear and its construction guarantees a great fit and disposable convenience. The facility that manufactures the NS&amp;reg; 7000 Dust Mask is ISO 9002 Registered and ISO 14001 Certified.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many workplaces have consistently high noise levels. Workers at these sites need to protect their hearing at all times, so it&amp;#39;s important to provide hearing protection. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/118-4004/3M-E-A-R-UltraFit-Corded-Reusable-Ear-Plugs-in-Polybag-NRR-25"&gt;3M&amp;reg; E-A-R&amp;trade; UltraFit&amp;reg; Corded Reusable Ear Plugs in Polybag&lt;/a&gt; are an excellent choice for any worker. With an NRR 25 rating and no rolling or sizing necessary, these &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; offer reliable hearing protection and a comfortable fit.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?skw=ear+plugs&amp;amp;st=1"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; are attached by a convenient cord that makes them easy to keep track of and always available for quick use. The plugs themselves are made with a curved triple flange design and a firm stem. This means that they can be quickly inserted and will offer the best level of noise protection by fitting the contours of any worker&amp;#39;s ear for an excellent seal.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Protecting worker&amp;#39;s feet from injuries is very important in workplace safety. Causes of foot injuries can range from impact from heavy falling objects, crushing that results from motor, industrial, or railroad vehicles rolling over the foot, punctures that come from stepping on something sharp, chemical splashes and burns, electric shock, extreme heat to cold or moisture, and any harm that comes from slipping and falling. The purchase and use of proper foot protection can help keep workers safe, so it&amp;#39;s important for employers to understand the different kinds of foot protection available.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most work boots are made from thick leather that offers a fair amount of protection and can be lined with polyester, nylon, fleece, or felt. Many boot manufacturers offer an added level of protection by adding steel or composite guards in the toe area. These guards help keep workers&amp;#39; toes safe from injuries. In comparison to steel toes, composite toes do not conduct electricity and give a bit more protection against heat and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Pull-on boots made of PVC, neoprene, nitrile, and blends can also be equipped with steel toes, midsoles, and metatarsal guards. Pull-ons are ideal for a wide variety of uses, including chemical plants, oil rigs, farming, food processing, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Other types of foot protection include overboots and overshoes. Boot and shoe covers fit over regular shoes and work boots, and will give workers added protection from water, snow, slush, chemicals, and hazardous or unsanitary conditions. Overboots offer added coverage for legs and can be offered to visitors who may need protective footwear at a worksite.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Accessories can also be purchased to enhance the protection that work boots offer. This includes aluminum and polycarbonate shields and guards for toes and the metatarsal bones on the top of the feet. Shields and guards can be quickly and easily slipped on or strapped onto shoes or boots, or tied into boot laces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA requires that boots are provided by employers for workers who spend time in areas where the danger of falling objects, rolling items, or electrical shock is particularly high. It is also necessary for foot protection to conform to ASTM requirements for impact resistance, compression resistance, metatarsal protection, conductive properties, electrical hazards, puncture resistance, and static dissipation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Boots are one of the most important &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that employers can provide to their workers. Foot injuries can happen too easily, and without the proper protection, these injuries will make it difficult for a worker to return to work quickly. Offering high-quality steel-toed or composite-toed work boots helps to keep employees safer and healthier while remaining productive at work.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Shallow cuts, scrapes, and abrasions may be minor in the realm of workplace injuries, but they should be tended to immediately. A well-stocked &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; is important to have on hand so that workers can treat their wounds in a timely manner. They also help ensure that minor injuries do not become infected. Employers should be sure to make first aid kits available at any workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most minor injuries only require an adhesive bandage, such as a Band-Aid&amp;reg;, or a small amount of gauze and tape. Bandages come in many varieties, and the appropriate should be used depending on the nature of the wound and the environment where a staff member works. There are waterproof adhesive bandages, ones made from flexible woven fabric, sheer strips, and heavyweight bandages for maximum strength that will not tear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Larger wounds that can&amp;#39;t be treated with a bandage and need more absorbency require an emergency pressure dressing. This type of first aid product is made from high-absorbency fabric or gauze. It should be applied with a great deal of pressure and wrapped tightly with a bandage roll.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to emergency pressure dressings, some cuts and lacerations can be treated with alternative supplies. Steri-Strips&amp;trade; and butterfly bandages are very small pieces of medical tape that can be used to bring the edges of a wound together to keep it closed and help reduce bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Severe wounds require medical attention. A doctor or medial professional should be called if:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; The edges of the wound are jagged&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The wound is on the face&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The edges of the wound gape open&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; There is dirt in the wound that won&amp;#39;t wash or rinse out&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The wound is draining pus&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The wound is tender and inflamed&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; The area around the wound has gone numb&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Red streaks are forming near the wound&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Bleeding is profuse and won&amp;#39;t stop in 20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For wounds that can be treated on-site, keeping &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid supplies&lt;/span&gt; in one central location, or multiple locations in larger facilities, is the basis for an effective and useful first aid program. Workers should be trained to know where these items are kept so that if an injury occurs, they will be able to quickly find and properly use bandages, Band-Aids&amp;reg;, emergency pressure dressings, Steri-Strips&amp;trade;, butterfly bandages, and other items. This knowledge, as well as the proper protocol for severe wounds, is essential to maintaining a sound and safe workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) announced the availability of $1 million in safety and health training grants. The announcement on August 3, 2011 advised that grant funds are tobe allocated towards the development and implementation of training and training procedures that would help to &amp;quot;identify, avoid, and prevent&amp;quot; hazardous working conditions in underground mines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The grants are available through the Brookwood-Sago grant program. This program was established through a provision in the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. In the coming fiscal year, funding will target plans to develop and implement training techniques and materials in order to further prepare mine workers for emergency preparedness and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Training is the key to proper and safe emergency response,&amp;quot; Joseph A. Main, Assistant Secretary of Labor for MSHA, said in a recent statement. &amp;quot;These funds will enable miners and mine emergency responders to receive the necessary training that may one day save lives if a mine emergency occurs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As many as 20 grants may be awarded for a 12-month performance period to either states or nonprofit entities, each grant will be at least $50,000, with a maximum award of $250,000. In addition, a new program structure allows applicants to apply for a renewal grant.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;MSHA requires that suitable &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; be worn while working in mines, including protective footwear, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to identify and evaluate the potential for respiratory hazard exposure in the workplace. The nature and magnitude of employee exposure must be measured before selecting respiratory protection equipment for your workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA has outlined three questions that employers should answer when completing this evaluation process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When must an employer conduct an exposure assessment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Examples of when hazards should be assessed include anytime OSHA issues a substance-specific standard or when workers bring signs of respiratory hazards to an attention. Some signs may be odor or irritation of the nose and throat.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the identity and nature of the airborne contaminant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Employers should then identify if the contaminant is a particulate, such as dust or aerosol, a gas or vapor, or a biological airborne contaminant. Once determined, the occupational exposure levels of the contaminate should be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much employee exposure is there in the workplace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Once the contaminant has been identified, it is important to make a &amp;quot;reasonable estimate&amp;quot; of the amount of exposure faced by workers through personal exposure monitoring and sampling. Sampling should use methods appropriate for the contaminant, and present the worst case exposure or represent enough shifts and operations to determine the range of exposure. Accounting for possible variations in exposure, should include the highest foreseeable employee exposure levels.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once when, what, and how much have been determined, a company should select what kind of respiratory protection equipment is required. As with any workplace safety assessment, a review of all &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; in use should also be done to maximize worker safety. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Jobs that require heavy lifting can strain muscles around backs and spines, especially when smart lifting practices are not followed. Consider the following guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to ensure that your workforce isn&amp;#39;t over-exerting itself.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper posture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                One of the most frequent causes of back strain is a poor or awkward posture that causes improper lifting. The body is designed to lift things, but it must be done correctly or the spine and the muscles surrounding it will bear the brunt of the strain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most important rule of thumb is to lift with your legs and not with your back. This means that you should never bend over an object before lifting it. Bending over requires the back to support the weight of both the object and your upper body. It also moves the load away from the body, allowing leverage to significantly increase the pressure on the back and spine. Objects that are being lifted should be placed as close to the body as possible and lifted up while straightening the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to the arms as well as the back. If workers need to reach out or up for an object before they pick it up, they are increasing the effective load and placing unnecessary strain on their shoulders by having the load away from the body. When objects are being moved, the surrounding area needs to be kept tidy to maintain easy access to the objects being lifted so that employees can avoid bending and reaching for those objects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrying items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Lifting can cause many injuries, but the act of carrying is also responsible for other ailments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lifting and carrying without taking a break can cause overexertion and injury. The ideal location for heavy objects being carried is in the &amp;quot;power zone,&amp;quot; which lies between the mid-thigh and the middle of the chest. At this point, carrying strength is at its most efficient. Workers should be encouraged to move very heavy objects first to stomach level on a table or box. After objects have been brought to this level, they should then be lifted and carried while keeping elbows close to the body.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Heavy objects should be held evenly by both hands and never on one shoulder, with one hand, or under one arm. This puts an imbalanced pressure on the spine, which can become damaged from overcompensating to balance the load.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hands should be taken into account as well and should be protected with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; while lifting. Proper handholds, such as handles, slots, or hole cut-outs on boxes, should always be utilized to make lifting and carrying easier and more efficient. Handholds on objects should always have enough room to accommodate a gloved hand.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, heavy loads should be broken down into smaller units so that workers don&amp;#39;t have to carry as much at once.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To ensure smart lifting, implement the use of forklifts, pallet jacks, and hand trucks to handle heavy objects and consider rotating or breaking up tasks to give muscles time to rest. Training your workforce about proper lifting techniques, including lifting and carrying loads that are balanced and in the &amp;quot;smart zone&amp;quot; will limit overexertion, sprains, and strains.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dust, dirt, and other particulates are often found in the air around a workplace. This can make it difficult, uncomfortable, and unhealthy for workers to perform their jobs. That&amp;#39;s why employers should provide the right types of disposable respirators. Workers will appreciate the fact that a respirator with an appropriate rating has been made available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provides designations for different levels of protection offered by respirators. They are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;N95 - protects against 95 percent of airborne particles and is not resistant to oil&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;N99 - protects against 99 percent of airborne particles and is not resistant to oil&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;N100 - protects against 99.97 percent of airborne particles and is not resistant to oil&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;R95 - protects against 95 percent of airborne particles and is somewhat resistant to oil, with use restricted to 8 hours&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;P95 - protects against 95 percent of airborne particles and is strongly resistant to oil&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;P99 - protects against 99 percent of airborne particles and is strongly resistant to oil&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;P100 - protects against 99.97 percent of airborne particles and is strongly resistant to oil&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to the level of protection from oil and airborne particulates that disposable respirators provide, there are a number of details that employers must take into account when choosing the right &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some variables to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some respirators come with exhalation valves. These devices help to expel warm, moist air and make it easier for the wearer to breathe. Exhalation valves provide added comfort when work is being done in a hot and humid environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are disposable respirators that come in hygienic packages and are folded flat for easy storage and distribution. This makes transporting them much easier, minimizes contamination, and ensures a clean, fresh respirator when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, the condensation that comes from breathing can escape from a disposable respirator and cause the eyewear to fog up. In these situations, it is helpful to use a respirator with an adjustable noseband, which keeps the mask sealed near the eyes to help block condensation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Convenient Handy Straps allow masks to be removed quickly, then lets the respirator hang around a worker&amp;#39;s neck, allowing workers fast, easy access to their respirator.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unlike many surgical masks that have ear loops, disposable particulate respirators offer a variety of elastic head straps for a more secure and comfortable fit. On disposable respirators with two straps, one goes over the ears and fits across the back of the head, while a second goes under the ears and around the back of the neck. Single strap respirators are worn with a strap that goes over the ears and around the back of the head. Straps can be made out of latex-free elastic or fabric, and they may be adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees who may be at risk for injury from motorists can wear high-visibility respirators to add even more visibility when used with other supplies such as safety vests. High-visibility respirators are brightly colored and stand out to make compliance checks for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Faceseals can be found lining the inside edge of some disposable respirators. These give workers a bit more comfort, and since the faceseal will fit to the shape of their faces, it provides a secure seal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some respirators are specialized for certain tasks or industries. These include fluid-resistant and bacterial filter respirators, which are useful in the medical industry. Many disposable respirators are designed to block welding fumes and nuisance levels of organic vapors, acid gases, or ozone.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers need to make sure that all workers are fit-tested for disposable respirators before they begin wearing them in hazardous environments. When not worn properly, the protection offered by a respirator is severely limited and may even make the respirator completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;Work gloves&lt;/a&gt; are often necessary to protect workers&amp;#39; hands. Choosing the right glove for the job ensures safety, provides comfort, and helps increase productivity. Coated gloves can provide workers with better grip and added protection, and they are ideal for use in a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers should purchase &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/126-22067/NS-Performer-Rubber-Coated-String-Knit-Work-Gloves"&gt;NS&amp;reg; Performer&amp;reg; Rubber Coated String Knit Work Gloves&lt;/a&gt; for use in handling, moving, and lifting objects with accuracy and dexterity. Made of string knit cotton, these gloves are cool and allow for air to flow in and out. The palms of these gloves are coated in rubber so that holding bricks, grasping heavy objects, and using tools won&amp;#39;t result in hand injuries. They also feature a knit wrist that blocks dirt and debris from getting inside the gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NS&amp;reg; Performer&amp;reg; Rubber Coated Work Gloves are an economical choice that offer workers improved abrasion resistance and unmatched grip for handling rough objects, and the string knit cotton construction ensures a comfortable fit. Workers in many jobs, including general maintainence, packaging, assembly, and light construction will appreciate the comfort and added protection.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Even though it is documented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that employers who develop and implement safety management systems significantly reduce workplace injuries and illnesses, these are the programs that tend to get cut in tough economic times.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index, workers compensation due to work-related injuries cost America $53 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Injury and illness can also lead to a decrease in productivity, morale and profits, suggesting that preventing such events allows businesses to operate more efficiently when effective safety and health management systems are implemented, according to OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Employers that invest in workplace safety and health can expect to reduce fatalities, injuries, and illnesses,&amp;quot; OSHA states. &amp;quot;This will result in cost savings in a variety of areas, such as lowering workers&amp;#39; compensation costs and medical expenses, avoiding OSHA penalties, and reducing costs to train replacement employees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Safety systems vary across workplaces, and include safety budgets for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and personal protective equipment as required by OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Working outdoors means coming into contact with all kinds of insects. At best, stings can cause pain and irritation, and at worst, an allergic reaction. It is important for workers to understand how to avoid being stung, know where to locate a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;, and help treat fellow workers who have been afflicted by an insect sting. Consider the following information from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hornets, wasps, and bees are often attracted to flowery perfumes or soaps, so workers who spend a great deal of their time outside should refrain from using fragrant products before coming to work. Products that have a banana odor are particularly appealing to these insects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lightly-colored clothes that cover as much skin as possible are best for avoiding bee stings and other attacks. Human sweat and oil can attract these insects, so workers need to be sure to wear clean clothes and bathe daily.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bees and hornets are attracted to the pollen that flowers produce, so it is a good idea to avoid working near flowers whenever possible. Wasps, on the other hand, are predators, and they are attracted to garbage and the remains of human food. Make sure to clean up all work areas after meals to avoid attracting these pests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When attacked by bees, hornets, or wasps, get to safety as quickly as possible, as bees release a chemical that attracts other bees when they sting. Shaded areas are better for escaping these insects than open areas. If possible, run indoors and close the door. If you are driving and discover an insect inside, you should slowly stop the car and roll down all the windows to let it escape. Never jump in the water to avoid a swarm of bees or hornets, because some species may stay above the surface and continue to sting when you come up for air.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that around 100 people die each year from allergic reactions to bee, wasp, and hornet stings. Workers who know they have these allergies should carry an epinephrine auto injector (EpiPen) and a medical signifier, such as a bracelet, necklace, or card, that contains information about their condition whenever they work outdoors. If workers do get stung, have someone stay with them to watch for any allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The area where the sting occurred should be washed with soap and water before attempting to remove the stinger. Do not attempt to remove it with tweezers or by squeezing the wound. Instead, run a clean fingernail or gauze from a first aid kit over the sting to draw the stinger out.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ice can be applied to a recent sting to help reduce swelling. Refrain from scratching or picking at a sting so that it doesn&amp;#39;t become further irritated or infected.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bees, wasps, and hornets are an inevitable part of any outdoor environment. Employers should keep all the necessary &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; on hand to treat stings and practice safety protocol with their workers so that they know what to do when someone has an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;At this year&amp;#39;s National Safety Council (NSC) Congress and Expo in Philadelphia, the International &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/span&gt; Association (ISEA) will be hosting a forum titled &amp;quot;Solutions from ISEA Experts,&amp;quot; which will cater to the personal protection equipment (PPE) user community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the discussion, experts from companies affiliated with ISEA will comment on the best ways organizations and companies can avoid violations and the steps manufacturers of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are taking to create a safer work environment. The representatives will give presentations on the standards, proper applications, performance, and design of PPE.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Speakers will also demonstrate new products that will be available soon and answer any questions attendees of the event may have.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Topics to be covered in the forum will include hearing and respiratory protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems, and PPE conformity assessment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The NSC Congress and Expo will begin on Sunday, October 30, and run through Friday, November 4, and will feature more than 800 companies. The event will provide safety, health, and environmental insights through various exhibitions, making the expo the &amp;quot;industry&amp;#39;s leading networking event,&amp;quot; according to exhibit highlights. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;These injuries, many of which could have been prevented with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, may result in lost production and workers&amp;#39; compensation claims. In some cases, accidents can lead to federal citations costing a company not only its reputation but tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A variety of factors can cause eye injuries, including airborne particles, flying objects or UV light. This can lead to temporary vision loss and, in some rare cases, permanent blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/110-19695/N-Specs-Raptor-Safety-Glasses-with-Clear-Polycarbonate-Lens?skw=110-19695" target="_blank"&gt;N-Specs Raptor&lt;/a&gt; safety glasses may be the ideal model for companies trying to encourage their workers to wear protective gear. Wraparound design and durable polycarbonate lens provide excellent UV resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These glasses look pretty cool, as well. The clear lenses and lightweight nylon frames give the Raptor work glasses a cool, modern look. Don&amp;#39;t let their style fool you; they meet the requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These sleek glasses won&amp;#39;t break the bank, either. The more you buy, the more you save.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) partnered in a campaign to recognize National Young Worker Safety Day (NYWSD) on June 21, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency joined with the CareerSafe Online program to educate youths at the SkillsUSA National Leadership and Skills Conference in Kansas City. Participants in the event - an estimated 5,600 high school and college students - had the opportunity to join the NYWSD campaign, sign safety awareness pledges, and take part in educational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every five days, one U.S. teen is killed on the job, according to OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. He added that more than 200,000 young workers are injured annually, which is a significantly higher number than other age categories.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OSHA is partnering in this campaign to make a significant and critical impact to decrease the number of youth worker injuries and fatalities in our country,&amp;quot; Michaels said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers who hire teen workers may want to make sure they have the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; on company property and at work sites. Items such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; can help keep inexperienced laborers from sustaining serious injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Are you sick of wearing those over-sized &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; that stick out on the job site like a sore thumb? Then maybe it&amp;#39;s time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many companies have the right intentions when they purchase safety glasses for their employees, but in some cases the equipment is uncomfortable and unsightly. The glasses may protect the individual&amp;#39;s eyes but they leave a lot to be desired in terms of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/110-22191/N-Specs-Riptide-Sport-Safety-Glasses-with-Clear-Lens" target="_blank"&gt;N-Specs Riptide Sport safety glasses&amp;nbsp;with clear lenses&lt;/a&gt; solve that problem without sacrificing safety. Their ultra-light lens accentuates your eyes more than most other brands. Their sleek design could be mistaken for a typical pair of glasses seen at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Riptide Sport comes with durable polycarbonate lenses that provide outstanding impact protection. They also offer excellent UV protection and have received approval from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Inadequate eye protection raises the risk for eye injuries. And an injury can negatively affect your personal and professional life. These affordable safety glasses will keep employees safe and comfortable on the job. Working hard never looked so good. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Safety training is integral to a company&amp;#39;s success. Employees who are properly trained on how to use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and perform &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security" class="dnautolink"&gt;lockout tagout&lt;/a&gt; procedures are more likely to feel secure in their work environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers who are looking to engage their workers during training sessions may want to consider going digital. E-learning programs are used everywhere in the U.S., by a wide variety of people, such as college-degree seekers, corporate leaders, and English-as-a-second-language learners.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Companies that value safety in the workplace may benefit from adopting digital training platforms. Many e-learning tools allow for multimedia presentations, which can include photo demonstrations showing the proper way to use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; or the location of a work site&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Argo Insurance recently announced that its grocery and retail division employees will soon have access to online safety training courses. These sessions will be designed to prevent accidents in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Training promotes safe work practices, increases employee safety awareness and prevents customer, and worker accidents, which is the key to controlling or reducing insurance costs over time,&amp;quot; said Bill Meisen, an official from Argo.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Are you tired of struggling to put on and take off your &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" target="_blank"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/122-19920/NS-FlexShield-Nitrile-8-Mil-Powder-Free-11-Disposable-Nitrile-Gloves-with-Textured-Fingers?skw=122-19920%20XL" target="_blank"&gt;NS&amp;#39;s 8 mil FlexShield nitrile gloves&lt;/a&gt; are an ideal solution, providing comfort and protection. Plus, the rolled cuffs add durability and make them easier to take on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These gloves are more puncture-resistant than natural rubber or vinyl disposable gloves. Their nitrile material eliminates the risk of allergic reactions commonly associated with latex &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;FlexShield work gloves are 8 mil thick and their 11 inch length provides added wrist and forearm protection. Manufactured from Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved materials, these disposable powder-free gloves have textured fingers that allow for a strong grip.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Each box comes with 50 gloves and the ambidextrous design saves time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers who are hard-pressed to find a safe, comfortable glove at an affordable price should purchase NS&amp;#39;s nitrile gloves. They are ideal for laboratories, assembly lines, and industrial settings. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A busy work site typically has its fair share of debris. Saw dust, dirt, and soot are materials commonly coating the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/105-3551" target="_blank"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This can become a significant problem when grime builds up on &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult for employees to see properly. It is important to clean your eyewear on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cleaning requires more than just simply dabbing water on the lenses and running a wash cloth over them. Hastily washing your safety glasses can cause scratches.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/105-3551/Northern-Safety-Pre-Moistened-Safety-Glasses-Lens-Cleaning-Anti-Fog-Towelettes-100-Dispenser-Box"&gt;Northern Safety&amp;#39;s pre-moistened safety glasses lens cleaning anti-fog towelettes&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for most job sites. They are conveniently stored in individual foil-wrapped packages, allowing workers to carry them in their pockets wherever they go.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The 5-by-8-inch towelettes are pre-moistened with C-Clear solution, which is anti-fog and anti-static.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;They are packed in a dispenser box with an easy-to-use pull-out bottom, each containing 100 towelettes. You don&amp;#39;t need to purchase a separate bag, bin, or box to display them at work sites. Making them readily available for all employees will ensure optimum protection and visibility for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Highway accidents are the leading cause of job-related deaths in America, accounting for 22 percent of fatal work injuries in 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Transportation workers are among the most vulnerable employees when it comes to this risk and should take special care to follow basic highway safety practices.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most common-sense tips are life-saving guidelines, so everything you&amp;#39;ve ever heard (repeatedly) about buckling your seat belt, not playing your music too loudly, and eliminating all other distractions goes double if you&amp;#39;re on the job. It goes without saying that no one should be intoxicated while behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Beyond the factors you can control, there are millions of variables that can interfere with a safe drive, especially those of the long distance variety. The sole defense truck drivers have against the unpredictability of the road is the ability to react quickly and effectively, so get plenty of rest before you drive and pull over to take a break if you&amp;#39;re starting to feel sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Transportation workers driving long distances cross-country or across multiple states benefit from having &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; on hand. It&amp;#39;s always a good idea to have a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; in the glove compartment or in another area that can be easily accessed by the driver of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Workplace environments with industrial machinery can be hazardous. Given the highly-specified nature of the work that many factory employees do, it is of the utmost importance that all new hires receive detailed instructions regarding the use of the machines. If there&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s equally important (or perhaps even more so), it&amp;#39;s basic common sense regarding the treatment of any and all machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To put it lightly, a factory setting is no place for horseplay. This should go without saying, but the fact remains that countless employees get injured every year due to carelessness in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maintaining one&amp;#39;s conduct is just as important as following the instructions on a machine, which extends to asking for help when in doubt and flagging a machine properly should it malfunction. By using the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?skw=lockout+tagout&amp;amp;st=1"&gt;lockout &lt;span data-scayt_word="tagout" data-scaytid="1"&gt;tagout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; procedures on a machine that may be out of order, you can help prevent the possibility of injury to a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Common sense also extends to the proper wear and maintenance of all work &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; should be worn at all times if required by company protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In basic workplace safety protocol, there&amp;#39;s one motto that&amp;#39;s likely to hold true in any kind of work environment. By adhering to &amp;quot;train first, ask questions later,&amp;quot; employees will ensure that they abide by all received instructions and avoid trying to figure things out for themselves, especially when operating dangerous equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those who work around industrial machinery should only handle equipment that they&amp;#39;ve been approved to operate - no exceptions. A warehouse stacker may seem fairly self-explanatory to maneuver, but numerous workplace accidents result from inexperience.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees who have been trained to handle a piece of equipment should always ask their supervisors for guidance if they have any questions - even if they received previous training on it. It&amp;#39;s better to ask for sound instruction than leave it to chance and risk injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The knowledge of how to operate a piece of equipment extends to &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; guidelines as well. Encourage all employees to consult a workplace expert should they have any doubts regarding the proper use of their &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, or other supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Employers needing help with new recordkeeping regulations proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) can now find it online.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency announced on June 28, 2011, that it has launched an interactive web tool called the OSHA Recordkeeping Advisor. The program simulates an employer&amp;#39;s interaction with a recordkeeping rules expert and caters specifically to the questions or concerns presented by users.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On June 22, 2011, OSHA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and outlined potential changes. One of the new rules, if passed, would require companies to report to OSHA all work-related fatalities and in-patient hospitalizations within eight hours, and work related amputations within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Along with the proposed changes, OSHA requested feedback from the public. The web tool is designed to help them better understand the intricacies of the proposed policies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Recordkeeping Advisor was developed to better help employers understand and comply with their responsibilities to report and record work-related injuries and illnesses,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to following recordkeeping regulations, employers should be sure that proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is being used at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) renewed its alliance with the Scaffold Industry Association (SIA) one day after it extended its partnership with the Sealant, Waterproofing, and Restoration Institute (SWR Institute).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On June 29, 2011, OSHA announced it would continue collaborating with SIA to develop the most effective &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; regulations. Since their alliance was first signed in 2008, the two organizations have published Transport Platforms and Mast Climbing Work Platforms safety materials relating to scaffold and fall hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;They also produced applicable materials containing American National Safety Institute (ANSI) consensus standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The goals of the renewed alliance include enhancing training and education programs as well as emphasizing the importance of using proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; on job sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Four of the 10 most frequently cited OSHA construction standards involve scaffolding, so renewing this alliance is a great opportunity to build on our work to better protect the men and women who work on scaffolds,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Companies using scaffolding in the U.S. require their employees to wear a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt; while working at high elevations. ile working at high elevations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Other than loud outdoor concerts and mowing your lawn, there are times when you should take extra steps to protect your hearing. No situation is more demanding of hearing protection than a loud work environment where you spend the majority of your week.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those workers who are subjected to loud machinery and other noises need quality &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/118-1900/3M-E-A-R-Express-Pod-Plugs-Reusable-Corded-Ear-Plugs-NRR-25"&gt;Express&amp;reg; Pod Plugs&amp;reg; Reusable Corded Ear Plugs&lt;/a&gt;. The Pod Plugs from Northern Safety aren&amp;#39;t your standard reusable &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;. They come with pliable handles for easy insertion as well as an advanced InstaSeal&amp;trade; system that allows the plugs to instantly and snugly conform to your unique ear shape.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These plugs are guaranteed for a snug fit thanks to the use of slow recovery foam, unique grips, and efficient pod shapes. As an added bonus, workers will be able to communicate and receive instructions more effectively as the use of minimal foam in the plugs reduces sound distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you work in an environment where it&amp;#39;s necessary to block out harmful noises while still remaining in touch with your colleagues, you&amp;#39;ll appreciate the NRR 25 Express&amp;reg; Pod Plugs&amp;reg; Reusable Corded Ear Plugs.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s little need to consult a health expert - most people who work a nine-to-five desk job are well aware of the physical toll that excessive sitting can take on their bodies. Fortunately, a few of these people have been proactive enough to come up with easy and simple ways to stay healthy while you type.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are less imminent workplace dangers than heavy machinery or unwieldy forklifts. The slow and steady damage resulting from carpal tunnel syndrome or lack of exercise can take an equally devastating toll on the body. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important to stay in motion throughout the workday and give proper attention to cramped wrists and hands.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Make it a point to get up for short breaks, at least once every hour. Experts agree that even a minute or two spent walking around can significantly aid in reducing physical strain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If your wrists start to feel sore from typing, use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as a wrist wrap to provide much-needed support while you work. Taking short breaks from typing may help to alleviate the tension, but it&amp;#39;s generally more effective to squeeze a rubber stress ball periodically, rotating your wrists, and using a small weight to strengthen your wrist muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While there&amp;#39;s no conclusive evidence that computer glare can cause permanent eye damage, it&amp;#39;s still best to avoid eye strain at any cost. Follow the 20-20-20 rule - every 20 minutes, look away for 20 seconds at an object that&amp;#39;s 20 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A publishing company recently announced it has released the Maine Handbook on Occupational Safety and Health, 2011-2012 edition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to The Times Record of Maine, Compliance Publications in &lt;span data-scayt_word="Damariscotta" data-scaytid="4"&gt;Damariscotta&lt;/span&gt;, Maine, produced the 500-page large-format manual. The material was provided by Maine&amp;#39;s Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Daniel &lt;span data-scayt_word="Goldenson" data-scaytid="2"&gt;Goldenson&lt;/span&gt;, the president of Compliance Publications, explained that the manual is &amp;quot;hands on&amp;quot; and designed to educate safety managers on the most up-to-date policies in the Pine Tree State. The handbook also comes with a CD and a Quick Start Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The manual &amp;ldquo;brings together in one place the key information that employers need in order to operate their workplaces safely and in compliance with both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Maine State Division on Workplace Safety,&amp;quot; said David &lt;span data-scayt_word="Wacker" data-scaytid="3"&gt;Wacker&lt;/span&gt;, the director of Workplace Safety and Health in Maine&amp;#39;s Labor Department.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 2009, an average of 3.1 out of every 100 workers in Maine missed days from work, transferred, or had restricted capabilities due to a work-related injury or illness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers can avoid these incidents by purchasing reliable &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; for their employees. Items such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; can help workers avoid injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), workplaces can reduce costs by 20 to 40 percent by establishing efficient safety and health management systems. &amp;nbsp;In addition, pursuing OSHA&amp;#39;s Volunteer Protection Program (VPP) Star Award , an accolade described as &amp;quot;more than just a safety program,&amp;quot; but a &amp;quot;culture-changing program,&amp;quot; can help in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA says the award is given to employers and workers in both private industry and in federal agencies who maintain workplace injury and illness numbers below the averages set by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Axcet, a company that recently earned the award, encourages other small businesses to strive for OSHA&amp;#39;s recognition, saying its dedication to safety, which includes access to a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, has paid off in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;From the top down, Axcet HR Solutions has displayed outstanding effort in implementing a comprehensive safety and health management system,&amp;quot; Charles E. Adkins, OSHA&amp;#39;s regional administrator in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a statement. &amp;quot;The company is an exemplar of workplace safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Workplace safety hinges upon two things - the quality of the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; being used and employee awareness. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; must be provided and worn correctly, but worker awareness is a bit more difficult to regulate. Employees that work in hazardous environments should remember these three phrases and the lessons they teach.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head on a swivel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                This phrase is used by coaches and athletes in many sports and simply reminds a worker to always look around. Employees should check their surroundings whenever possible so that they can quickly become familiar with their environment. Without a proper sense of the equipment and fixtures nearby, the risk of accident and injury increases.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look twice, move once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Whenever moving through an area with machinery or activity, workers need to look for common warehouse dangers. Conveyor belts, forklifts, and loading docks are particularly dangerous and should be checked twice to make sure that they&amp;#39;re not moving before walking near them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                No matter how fast employees want to work, jobs that people do in potentially hazardous places can never be done too slowly. It is a good idea for all workers to occasionally take stock of their speed and ask themselves, &amp;quot;Am I moving too quickly?&amp;quot; Moving too fast leads to carelessness and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are some workplace accidents that come out of the blue. Machine failures and bad luck can strike at any time. However, there are occasionally telltale clues that something may be amiss on the floor of a factory or with warehouse&amp;#39;s equipment. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) sponsors a program that can train employees to be on the lookout for these red flags.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) offers classes and training to the workers of any company that signs up for it. Certification in the VPP ensures that all employees have been adequately shown how to spot hazards that could lead to injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some things to be aware of while on the job include puddles of water, loose power lines, machinery that behaves strangely, and unusual debris. The key to getting staff to help make a workplace safer is to train them to be constantly vigilant. Workers who have been shown the signs of potential danger will be more likely to point it out to a supervisor and reduce overall injury rates. OSHA estimates that workplace injuries account for over $170 billion in losses annually.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Beyond properly educating employees, companies should provide the best &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; are crucial to maintaining a safe workplace. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently called for two stakeholder meetings to discuss exposure to infectious diseases in the workplace. Information gathered at these meetings will be used to develop proposed rules to protect healthcare workers from occupational exposure to infectious agents and the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; necessary to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Information gained from these meetings will help us determine the best approach to assure that workers don&amp;rsquo;t put themselves at risk while caring for patients and doing their job. After all, a good job is a healthy and safe job,&amp;quot; Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The meetings will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a program standard that would limit occupational exposure to infectious diseases, focus on how employers would implement new infection control measures, and identify any current OSHA rules that need to be assessed or revised.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Health Institute has outlined proper procedures all health care workers should follow, which include staying up to date with immunizations, using gloves and masks, and making tissues and hand cleaners available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is adopting the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) in 2011, in an effort to communicate the hazards of certain chemicals to workers through labels and material safety data sheets (MSDS).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA intends to incorporate the GHS into the current system, the Hazard Communication Standard, (HCS) by August 2011, and align it closer to the GHS. Its goal is to &amp;quot;create new compliance obligations for everyone in the lifecycle of hazardous materials.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When the changes are adopted by OSHA, chemical manufacturers will have to write new MSDSs, and entire MSDS libraries will need to be updated in a short period of time. Much of the updating has been completed, but more work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;GHS is coming and chemical manufacturers, employers, and safety professionals should already be preparing,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Flynn, vice president of product development at MSDSonline.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA states that the GHS is not a model that can be adopted easily. It involves a long process of choosing parts of the system that apply to existing regulations and preparing literature consistent with current requirements. Provisions that are not affected by the alignment will remain the same, such as the training offered by the HCS system and currently preferred &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has renewed its alliance with the Scaffold Industry Association (&lt;span data-scayt_word="SIA" data-scaytid="1"&gt;SIA&lt;/span&gt;) in an effort to protect the health and safety of scaffold workers, and to prevent falls and other deadly accidents associated with the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alliance was originally formed in 2008, and has since developed Transport Platforms and Mast Climbing Work Platforms and American National Safety Institute consensus standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Reasons for renewing the alliance include increasing awareness of the rules and initiatives enforced by OSHA, writing new training programs, and conducting outreach activities on the rights of workers and employer&amp;#39;s responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-scayt_word="SIA" data-scaytid="2"&gt;SIA&lt;/span&gt; was founded in 1972 to represent the scaffold, aerial lift, and access industry, and has worked to promote safety in these areas through training courses, audiovisual practices, and codes of safe practice.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Alliance Program of OSHA works with groups committed to bettering workplace safety and preventing fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. Benefits of the cooperative program include increased worker access to effective workplace &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, and the establishment of continuous &lt;span data-scayt_word="dialogue" data-scaytid="3"&gt;dialogue&lt;/span&gt; between agencies and OSHA, which can lead to progress in worker rights, health, and safety.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to protect the health of workers and reduce disability claims for companies that have potentially dangerous work environments. Good &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; can physically protect workers, and effective safety guidelines for employee behavior are also helpful. However, the best tool is to teach workers about your company&amp;#39;s safety procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A business can have excellent plans for accident reporting, emergency contacts, and injury response, but if employees aren&amp;#39;t aware of what these situations call for, procedures won&amp;#39;t be utilized properly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It follows that workers should be educated properly and often. The best way to do this is to formalize the teaching of safety techniques. Training sessions should be standardized so that all workers receive the same lessons about how to use safety equipment such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Safety protocols also require regular review. Despite being taught well the first time, many employees might become forgetful of their training if they aren&amp;#39;t given an opportunity to practice what they have been taught. Regular safety drills and equipment checks are essential for preserving safety in your workplace. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Mercy Tiffin Hospital, located in Tiffin, Ohio, was recently awarded the 2011 Ohio Hospital Safety Campaign Award for employee safety. The hospital was also one of 14 hospitals to earn a Top Twenty Percent Award. In total, 29 hospitals were recognized statewide for their commitment to employee safety and use of inspected &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mercy Tiffin Hospital is dedicated to ensuring our staff is working in a safe environment,&amp;rdquo; Dale Thornton, President and CEO of Mercy Tiffin Hospital, said in a statement. &amp;ldquo;There are many safety initiatives and programs available for our employees. We encourage our employees to maintain safe workstations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hospitals apply for candidacy for the award by taking information, which they are required to maintain for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and submitting it to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Injury rates, which are used in selection, are calculated by dividing the number of injury cases by days away from work per 200,000 hours by the number of hours worked that year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For 58 years the Ohio Hospital Association Statewide Hospital Safety campaign has been honoring hospitals with exceptional safety programs and employee safety records. The award was created to promote safer workplace standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In June of 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set new directives for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; regulations involved with the residential construction industry. These changes will strongly affect industry professionals such as roofers, weather proofers, and others involved in residential construction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA now requires fall protection, which includes guardrails, safety nets, personal fall arrest systems, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; to be used in residential construction project above 6 feet. If employers can demonstrate that there is not a feasible way to implement these measures, or that perhaps that they would create even more of a hazard, a site specific, written plan must be provided. This plan must specify alternate methods that will be used to eliminate or reduce the possibility of a fall.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The previous regulations stated that employers could use alternative measures such as safety monitoring systems and were not required to prove the infeasibility or greater hazard-risk of the conventional measures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA intends to increase its enforcement, stating that employers will no longer be allowed to bypass conventional fall protection.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A lot of workers realize that dangerous jobs are usually also difficult. They will also point out that both of these things are especially true where hazardous chemical particulates are involved. In addition to working with machinery and being aware of regulations you have to follow, there are extra steps involved just keeping your employees safe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Airborne chemical particulates damage the respiratory system, which explains why a lot of employers require workers to wear face masks, filters, and cartridges. These lifesaving devices help prevent illness and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Full facepiece respirators can be hot and uncomfortable. It&amp;#39;s a small price to pay for your health, but many workers suffer needlessly in hot work conditions. Companies with workplaces that regularly see chemicals handled or treated should buy the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/152-7417/3M-6000-Series-Full-Facepiece-Respirator"&gt;3M 6000 Series Full Facepiece Respirator&lt;/a&gt;. This model is soft, lightweight, and reduces lens fogging and sweating thanks to a unique center adapter that directs exhaled breath and moisture away from the face. A clear view of one&amp;#39;s surroundings and a cool head make hazardous jobs a bit more bearable. Purchase a full facepiece respirator and the other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; you need to work around chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Doctors from the Alaska Native Medical Center have announced that virtually all fishing-related eye injuries, in both salt and fresh water, can be prevented with protective lenses. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;should always be&amp;nbsp;used when fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Eye injuries can result in extreme vision loss or loss of the eye, and are not easily fixed. Prevention, rather than repair, is the most important aspect in eye safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The world is filled with warnings for everything and ophthalmologists hate to raise one more voice in this symphony,&amp;quot; the authors wrote in a column for the Arctic Sounder, &amp;quot;however, the necessity of wearing eye protection when people nearby are violently flinging sharpened bits of metal through the air is obvious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The doctors stated that the most common fishing-related eye injuries occur when hooks, while under tension from the line, become dislodged from the fish, and whip back into the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Commercial fisherman are advised to wear polycarbonate protective lenses, which are readily available, to reduce the risks of eye injury by hooks that are used on fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Civil engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (&lt;span data-scayt_word="PennDOT" data-scaytid="1"&gt;PennDOT&lt;/span&gt;) Douglas M. Thompson, of North Fayette Township, Pennsylvania, was recently recognized with &lt;span data-scayt_word="PennDOT's" data-scaytid="4"&gt;PennDOT&amp;#39;s&lt;/span&gt; highest recognition, the Star of Excellence Award.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to a recent PennDOT release, 28&amp;nbsp;employees received the award statewide for their work done at Pennsylvania highway construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These employees are being recognized for going above and beyond what&amp;rsquo;s expected of them,&amp;quot; &lt;span data-scayt_word="PennDOT" data-scaytid="3"&gt;PennDOT&lt;/span&gt; Secretary Barry J. &lt;span data-scayt_word="Schoch" data-scaytid="5"&gt;Schoch&lt;/span&gt; said in the news release. &amp;quot;Despite constant fiscal challenges and the increasing demands placed on them, they are dedicated to producing excellent results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thompson was honored with the award because of his involvement in the largest bridge program ever and his commitment to safety. He ensured that all staff had required training when using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; on site, and helped to develop a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; program for District 11.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thompson&amp;#39;s first duties as a civil engineer included safety inspections, a skill which he has carried ever since. While working high on bridges is not as dangerous as it used to be, Thompson regularly made sure his workers were properly secured with a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The most effective strategies for workplace safety begin at the top and move downwards. This means that managers and supervisors are the most important figures in ensuring that safety regulations are followed, since they are the link between executives and the workforce. There are many hats that a successful manager must wear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Besides leading training sessions, a supervisor will help to create the classes. A manager will also help to understand OSHA regulations and determine how they fit with the makeup and needs of a company.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety equipment expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Managers need to be familiar with all of the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that a workplace uses, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and any other specialized equipment that is unique to a worksite. If &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory protection, or &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; equipment is necessary to prevent injuries, a supervisor must be familiar with how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Workplace accidents require investigations to discover the circumstances and how to keep the same situation from happening again. Supervisors should be familiar with basic investigative techniques so that they can report details of the incident to upper management, and, if necessary, OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record keeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Logs of accidents, equipment repair, and training are essential in organizing a safe workplace. A good manager will keep detailed accounts of training and incidents at a worksite. Without these records, it&amp;#39;s difficult to develop better safety protocols and prove that a company is complying with OSHA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Three Dot Foods warehouse employees recently took part in a company-sponsored Forklift Rodeo where the workers&amp;#39; skills with forklifts and trucks were tested, and their knowledge of warehouse safety was examined.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Thirty competitors from eight distribution centers (DCs) participated in the event, which included maneuvering through an obstacle course that mimicked the typical layout of a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To emphasize safety, Dot added two stop-and-honk intersections to the course.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The contestants did a great job of focusing on safety first, then speed. This was evident in the low number of infractions issued due to not stopping and honking,&amp;quot; Rocky &lt;span data-scayt_word="Vecera" data-scaytid="1"&gt;Vecera&lt;/span&gt;, assistant warehouse manager of Dot&amp;#39;s Indiana DC, said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to stress the importance of proper forklift and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; use, the company offered a free vacation to the top three finishers in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dot holds the race every year during Warehouse Appreciation Week at all of its distribution centers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, about 3 million workers face the risk of injury if&amp;nbsp;safety measures are not enforced by employers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a number of tips to help workers reduce their risk of injury or illness during the summer months, which include preventing harm done by the sun, dealing with extreme heat, and coping with insects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to protect your skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it is important to stay out of the sun by avoiding unnecessary exposure during the hottest times of the day. Wearing a broad-rimmed hat and a light, long-sleeve shirt can drastically reduce the chances of sunburn and eye damage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wearing sunscreen with a high SPF rating is also a proven way to ward off the negative effects of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Those who work outside at construction sites or in agriculture fields are at high risk for heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can significantly impair a worker servicing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and machinery. To avoid this, employers should allow flexibility in work arrangements so that rests may be taken. In addition, they should make sure that a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; is on hand so workers have the necessary items to handle small-scale medical situations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another hazard of outdoor working is the threat of insect bites and stings, which could possibly endanger the lives of workers. When working around potentially harmful insects, it is important to wear &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and the proper footwear and clothing to prevent being stung or bitten.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Ely of Pennsylvania State University is spreading awareness that July is Eye Injury Prevention Month, hoping more people will start wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and other protective lenses while working.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Ophthalmology estimates that more than 2 million eye injuries were reported in the country last year, and that 90 percent of the incidents were preventable. Of all the accident victims, only 5 percent were wearing glasses designed for safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Ely said that both consumers and employees need to be aware of the dangers of eye injury, and that all companies should follow occupational protective eyewear safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do yourself, and your eyes, a service this summer and invest in a pair of protective eyewear,&amp;quot; Dr. Ely said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Amanda Ely is a member of The Penn State Hershey Eye Center, which is committed to providing high quality eye care and works to continually improve eye care throughout the United States through research and education.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;One of the most fragile parts of the human body is the eye. Our eyes provide us with our most used sense and they can be easily damaged. In work environments that deal with flying debris or particles, the protection of employees&amp;#39; eyes should be a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Consequently, goggles, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and other types of shields should be standard equipment at factories, construction sites, and other production facilities. Some workers should also be required to wear safety glasses at all times, especially when chipping, grinding, and operating saws and drills.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Over-the-glass safety glasses can be uncomfortable for some workers that wear prescription glasses. Now, workers with ANSI-approved prescription glasses can add these slip-on side shields for complete protection. It&amp;#39;s important to make sure your workers have adequate protection that&amp;#39;s comfortable and ANSI-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An excellent choice is &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/103-23792/N-Specs-Safety-Eyewear-Premium-Slip-On-Safety-Side-Shields-for-Eyeglasses"&gt;N-Specs&amp;reg; Premium PVC Slip-On Safety Side Shields for Eyeglasses&lt;/a&gt;. Easily fitting on most spectacles with no tools or extra parts required, these safety shields will give added protection and will meet ANSI requirements when they are worn with ANSI-approved eyewear.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When you think about workplace safety, the hazards that come to mind will often include noxious chemicals, dangerous machinery, and the threat of electric shock. These are all serious things to be wary of while on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most machinery in manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and at construction sites produces noise that can damage hearing. Loud noise is a serious threat to human health because it can do permanent harm. Anyone who has ever listened to loud music will realize that it doesn&amp;#39;t take a lot of volume to produce sound-dullness and ringing in the ears. However, what some might not realize is that dullness and ringing represent dying cells, never to return again.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As a result, it&amp;#39;s crucial that employers provide workers at loud workplaces with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; to protect their hearing. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/117-PF220/Moldex-Pura-Fit-Uncorded-Disposable-Ear-Plugs-NRR-33?skw=Moldex%20Pura-Fit%20Uncorded%20Disposable%20Ear%20Plugs"&gt;Moldex Pura-Fit Uncorded Disposable Ear Plugs, with NRR 33,&lt;/a&gt; should be kept on-hand at all times in high-volume situations. Their tapered shape makes for easy insertion and will fit comfortably in any worker&amp;#39;s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Not only is hearing important to workers on the job, but it is also an important part of everyday life outside work.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An excellent way to maintain workplace safety is to implement clear regulations that workers can easily remember and apply. When injuries or accidents occur, it is important that all workers react quickly to ensure that no accident becomes even worse. In addition to proper training and frequent practice, workers need to be reminded of emergency procedures on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One means of accomplishing this is to post regulations in multiple areas around a workplace to ensure that workers will regularly read them. A particularly effective spot is in a break room or kitchen where workers usually congregate for breaks and meals. Posting procedures in multiple locations will make it possible for employees to familiarize themselves with them during various parts of their days.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another good place is in employee bathrooms. Most workers are likely to read posters and notes on the wall of a lavatory. By the same token, elevators, waiting rooms, and other areas where workers may spend time are great locations to reinforce emergency procedures. These regulation and procedure reminders will stay with employees longer and can hopefully be called upon when trouble strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to posting regulations around the workplace, employers should be sure that proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is being used at all times. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; should be worn at all times if required by company protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued a warning on July 6, 2011, that scissor lifts can be extremely dangerous when used to film events.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scissor lifts, which are portable and powered by hydraulics, are often used by colleges and high schools to film sporting events and band performances. In one instance, a student worker was killed while filming a Notre Dame football practice. The worker raised the lift more than 39 feet on a day when winds were exceeding 50 mph, and the lift was blown over.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA declared that employers can minimize scissor lift hazards by implementing safe practices in the workplace, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; inspections, positioning and stabilizing the lift, and knowing when weather conditions create a danger that would not permit use of the lift.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To further decrease the risk of injury or death when operating scissor lifts, workers should be properly trained and made aware of the possible risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA provides health and safety tips on using scissor lifts and presents guidelines for employers who work on scaffolding and other high places, and encourages employers to take part in free on-site consultations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently issued a new directive establishing a National Emphasis Program (NEP) for &amp;nbsp;the Primary Metals Industries based on data that found workers in the sector are regularly exposed to serious safety and health hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Primary Metals Industries group includes companies that smelt or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals. Some products these groups manufacture are nails, wires and cables, and steel piping.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA has written an instruction that outlines policies and procedures that should be implemented to form a National Emphasis Program, which would identify and reduce the exposure of workers to harmful conditions in the Primary Metals Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Included in the NEP are provisions for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and measures of controlling local exhaust ventilation to remove any air-contaminants, substitution of less hazardous materials, and general dilution ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA intends to inspect facilities and enforce the guidelines during follow up visits to the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency hopes to &amp;quot;raise awareness of the dangers of exposure to metals and other chemicals so that employers can correct hazards and comply with OSHA standards&amp;quot; and so that employers will voluntarily comply with current regulations.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The eyes are perhaps the most fragile part of the body, and OSHA requires employers to ensure the safety of all workers - and this includes protecting their eyes. To help you make sure workers will wear their &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, a wide assortment of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; are available to fit a variety of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Safety glasses protect the eyes from flying particles generated when grinding, using hammers and other hand tools, drilling, working on machinery, and much more. When working with hot machinery, it&amp;#39;s important to see what you&amp;#39;re doing, and if you walk away, being able to see where you&amp;#39;re going. Tasks are more easily completed with the right safety eyewear, so you&amp;#39;ll want to choose the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/110-23854/N-Specs-Riptide-Safety-Glasses-with-Clear-Anti-Fog-Lens"&gt;N-Specs&amp;reg; Riptide&amp;reg; Safety Glasses with Clear Anti-Fog Lens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Riptide&amp;reg; safety glasses are lightweight, so they&amp;#39;re comfortable enough to be worn for long periods of time. Adjustable temples allow many different workers to wear the same model, and their anti-fog lenses make them quickly eliminate fogging.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;N-Specs&amp;reg; Riptide&amp;reg; Safety Glasses comply with ANSI standards for impact resistance and provide excellent UV protection. Their cool look is popular with workers, and their great price helps you save more.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Education is the best defense against injury and illness in the workplace. When employees understand the risks and dangers involved in their jobs, they can maintain safety more effectively. Here are some of the best ways to teach workers about hazards in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Ideally, employees will become so familiar with safety regulations that they can teach newer workers. While veteran staff members can reinforce certain safety measures, management should always be the first point of contact for hires that are learning about the workplace for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker suggestions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                If employers are open to suggestions from workers about how to make a workplace safer, there will be added interest and pride in the choices that are made. Staff will feel as if they have been included in the process and will be more likely to remember regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Workers should be taught about every tool that they&amp;#39;ll be using for their jobs, including the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; that they&amp;#39;ll wear. Employers can provide several different choices for personal protection. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; come in different varieties. When choosing from pre-approved equipment, workers can select the most comfortable style for themselves. Every worker is different, but you can improve compliance when you give your workers a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever been injured on the job or seen a co-worker hurt knows that it is a stressful and confusing event. During these moments, it is often difficult for staff to react appropriately. Even excellent training and education aren&amp;#39;t always enough to help workers and managers respond according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As a result, supervisors need to demonstrate correct safety protocols and be able to teach them effectively. One of the best ways to do this is by planning, preparing, and running thorough training drills. Management and supervisors should work together on mock accident scenarios. Supervisors and workers should then practice the proper responses to these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;using work gloves&lt;/span&gt; or any other necessary &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; should also be included in mock accident training drills.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Repetition, hands-on training, and regular review of accident protocols will remove the most dangerous part of the equation - panic. Knowledge and confidence will combine to provide a calmer staff and a safer workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt; are hardly optional in workplaces that contain dangerous equipment. Construction, manufacturing, and many other industries demand that workers wear gloves at all times. After all - hands are one of the most important body parts, and while injuring them is easy, wounded fingers make work nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Operating heavy machinery often requires intricate maneuvers. Levers need to be pulled, buttons need to pushed, and wheels need to be turned. However, that&amp;#39;s no excuse to take off your &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, so many forklift operators, crane controllers, and truck drivers have to contend with uncomfortable gloves while at work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;For full hand movement and strong protection all in one, worksite supervisors should purchase &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/123-1665/NS-Hand-Protection-Grain-Leather-Drivers-Gloves-with-Keystone-Thumb"&gt;NS&amp;reg; Grain Leather Driver&amp;#39;s Gloves with Keystone Thumb&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to operating heavy equipment, gloves that allow full movement and reduce hand fatigue are an important &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supply&lt;/a&gt;. Farmers, construction workers, and truck drivers will all benefit from driver&amp;#39;s gloves that can set their minds at ease. Abrasion resistance means that scratches, cuts, and scrapes can be deflected easily to avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reports that one of the most common cause of safety citations is the mishandling of a forklift. This extremely useful but dangerous machine accounts for many injuries and accidents every year. Here are some ways to reduce these incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                It may seem easy to use at first, but a forklift is much different than a car, truck, or other vehicle that operators may have driven before. Because a forklift carries heavy items and often operates indoors, it requires that those who drive it have been thoroughly trained and certified. This means that an experienced, certified forklift trainer must teach and certify all new forklift operators, with re-certification required every three years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                There is never any condition that warrants operating a forklift in excess of five miles per hour. Any speed faster than that is reckless and doesn&amp;#39;t help to get work done any faster. The equipment and supplies that are usually found around forklifts can be knocked over and can easily injure workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Forklifts are like any other piece of heavy equipment - they require regular safety checks. All the parts of a forklift should be monitored regularly. In particular, tires need to be examined to make sure that they aren&amp;#39;t cracked or damaged, and have the proper amount of air.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                As with any other piece of machinery, the proper operation of a forklift involves the use of adequate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;. OSHA and employer requirements for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and goggles should be complied with.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Physical trauma is one of the biggest threats in many workplaces, but chemicals can be even more dangerous. They often have different storage needs, can easily ignite, and are apt to react powerfully when not handled correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As a result, it is important to understand all of the variables that affect how chemicals should be treated in the workplace. Any employee who could possibly come into contact with a hazardous chemical needs to undergo rigorous training. At a minimum, supervisors and management need to be sure that there is a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for every substance at a workplace. Even something as common as liquid soap or hand sanitizer - if it&amp;#39;s in your workplace, you should have MSDSs on file.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An MSDS documents all of the information staff would need to know about any substance. That includes its composition, how to identify it, first aid requirements for a variety of situations including inhalation, other chemicals that could have an adverse reaction with it, how it should be transported, and other essential details. MSDS literature comes from chemical manufacturers and should be included with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To properly use an MSDS, supervisors and managers should review the data sheets for the chemicals commonly used at a worksite. Additionally, the location of every MSDS should be made clear to workers so that if the worst should happen, the important data is close at hand. An MSDS can also include the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and safety gloves, that are important to use when dealing with chemical spills and dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many of the dangers at warehouses, factories, and other worksites involve heavy machinery, hazardous chemicals, and electrical wiring. Even if you&amp;#39;ve been trained properly to deal with these things and wear proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and goggles, a messy work area is cause for concern. Keeping a workplace clean is a valuable safety tip.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A clean floor is the only way to guarantee safety. Trash, clutter, moisture, and debris can interfere with forklift operation, cause ladders to slip, and can cause slips, trips, and falls. Janitors and custodians may be responsible for clean-up, but supervisors should also make sure that everyone is doing his part to keep a workplace clean. Regular housekeeping shifts or rotating cleaning duties should be assigned so workplace floors stay clean.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nails, splinters, holes, and loose tiles can cause injury and damage equipment. Supervisors should regularly inspect buildings and worksites with a checklist to note anything out of place. Asking workers to report damages and broken fixtures so that maintenance workers can fix them is important to workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently concluded a 90-day investigation, sparked by the March nuclear disaster in Japan, which found that better safety measures need to be adopted at nuclear power plants across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to an NRC press release, the report filed by the government panel suggested that nuclear plant operators should be ordered to re-assess the risk of earthquakes and floods, and more protective equipment and battery operated communication systems need to be available in the event of a disaster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The NRC developed 12 recommendations that plant operators could take that would &amp;quot;increase safety and redefine what level of protection to public health is regarded as adequate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our recommendations are grouped into four areas beyond the overarching suggestion to&amp;nbsp;clarify the agency&amp;rsquo;s regulatory framework,&amp;quot; NRC veteran and review team leader Charles Miller said in the release. &amp;ldquo;We looked at ensuring protection, enhancing accident mitigation, strengthening emergency preparedness, and improving the efficiency of NRC programs.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, there are 104 operating nuclear reactors in the country in 31 states. Vermont has the highest usage of nuclear energy at 73.3 percent. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, coveralls, boots, and respirators is required for the protection of workers at nuclear power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A partnership between Pioneer Construction, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), and the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA) was formally signed. This partnership will protect construction workers on a project at Grand Valley State University, according to a recent statement released by LARA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The goal of the partnership is to enhance health protection and proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, and to record zero injuries for workers on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order to attain this goal, LARA and OSHA worked with Pioneer to engineer techniques to assure safety at all times. These items include 100 percent &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; over six feet, 100 percent eye protection through &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and substance abuse testing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re proud to recognize Pioneer Construction&amp;#39;s commitment to send every construction worker home healthy and whole, every day,&amp;quot; LARA Deputy Director Steve Arwood said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;MIOSHA has made 10 similar partnerships with contractors on other construction projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Partnerships are a cooperative agreement that help not only MIOSHA but also contractors carry out the mission of protecting workers&amp;rsquo; safety and health,&amp;rdquo; safety manager for MIOSHA Paul Wrzesinski said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If your work includes loading and unloading pallets from a truck or trailer, there are a lot of safety issues to take into account. There&amp;#39;s quite a bit of weight going back and forth, and it has to be carefully supported so that you and your equipment don&amp;#39;t fall. It&amp;#39;s also possible for pallets to fall and break open. Here are some important things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The possibility of a truck or trailer rolling away is one of the most common problems with loading and unloading at docks. First, set the brakes. Then, before moving any items, workers need to make sure that they&amp;#39;ve chocked the wheels of the trailer to keep it from moving away from the dock. Forklift drivers who move freight on and off the trailer - not the truck driver - are responsible for making sure that the trailer&amp;#39;s wheels are chocked.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dockboards are supports that are placed between the trailer bed and the dock. Make sure you check their rating and put them down securely. Dockboards have numbers that tell workers how much weight they can support, so no items should ever be transported on them if they&amp;#39;re heavier than the dockboard rating.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dockplates work the same way as dockboards, but are used for non-motorized loading and unloading. Their ratings also need to be checked. You should also examine both of these items for weaknesses or damage that might make them break when you move materials over them. Whenever you go over a dockplate or drive over a dockboard, do it carefully and slowly, since this is the most dangerous part of dock work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dock locks hook onto a trailer&amp;#39;s impact guard to keep a trailer secured against a dock. Keeping a trailer locked to a dock ensures safety against trailer creep and early truck departures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Transporting pallets at a dock involves risk, so forklift operators need to wear proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; at all times. This includes &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, steel-toed boots, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;. No loading or unloading should be done without these items.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you work at a warehouse, factory, or even an office - gravity will always be there. OSHA warns that this is a source of injury, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; including back supports, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; should be used. Workers need to be aware of ways to store materials properly to prevent accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When boxes, drums, or any other sort of container are organized in a storage area, the most important thing to remember is that they have to be securely stored. Any unbalanced material can be unstable, so workers should check to make sure that every item they store is solid and doesn&amp;#39;t rock. No object should ever hang over the edge of the one under it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sturdy shelving is ideal for items that don&amp;#39;t have the same size or weight. The best rule of thumb is to keep the biggest and heaviest objects on the bottom shelves. Based on supplies or freight being received, items may have to be reorganized if they aren&amp;#39;t unloaded in order of size, but it is worth the effort if it prevents injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Aisles or passageways between rows need to be kept clear of all debris. When loading and unloading freight, workers should always be aware of stockroom and warehouse safety rules.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When following the rules created by OSHA, businesses with more than 10 employees are required to record any injury or illness that happens on the job. The cases that must be logged need to meet three criteria. First, the injuries must be work-related. Second, they must be new injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The third criteria is that the injury must be so severe that it resulted in death, amputation, days away from work, transfer to another job, restricted work, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness. Companies are required by law to record these injuries and report them to OSHA. This information is also a good way for businesses to create their own workplace safety guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When managers review the list of every accident and injury that happened at a particular worksite, they can start to get an idea of the most dangerous jobs and the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies"&gt;first aid kits&lt;/a&gt; required. They can then use this information to create training programs and practice drills that help to prevent the most common injuries before working their way toward the less common ones.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many important workplace tools, such as forklifts, run on electricity and need to be charged periodically. The charging stations that are used for this contain very large chemical batteries that store the electricity that comes from a wall socket. There are many hazards associated with these batteries that workers need to understand in order to keep themselves and their co-workers safe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the charging process, batteries can produce explosive hydrogen and oxygen fumes. Employers should make sure that there are multi-purpose, dry chemical, and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers available. There should also be a supply of soda ash nearby, which can be dumped on chemicals to neutralize them. It is very important to place charging stations in areas that are very well-ventilated to avoid the build-up of hydrogen gases.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Batteries contain sulfuric acid that is very corrosive. This substance can splash onto workers and irritate eyes and skin. It&amp;#39;s important to wear proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, protective clothing, and chemical-resistant gloves when handling them. An eyewash station should be placed near a charging station so that staff members who have gotten chemicals in their eyes can immediately flush them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Trained workers should be the only ones to charge and change batteries in the charging station. These employees should always be trained on all proper emergency procedures, including acid splash, fires, and how to use emergency eyewash and shower facilities. Proper safety protocol will help prevent this risk, which may otherwise cause chemicals to spill, explosions to occur, and fires to start.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/span&gt; Association (ISEA) recently announced there was an error in the original document on chemical hazards, &amp;quot;American National Standard for Classification and Performance Requirements for Chemical Protective Clothing,&amp;quot; and has released clarification on the issues presented.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency clarified that Note a) of Table 3 that was attributed to abrasion resistance in protective wear is not applicable.&amp;nbsp;The note only applies to flex cracking resistance. The agency noted that the text within the body of the standard on abrasion resistance is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Also, questions arose over the requirements for permeation and liquid penetration found during pressure testing. In response, the ISEA stated that it was not required for a product to receive a Level L for each agent listed in the original report in order to be compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;However, if the protective materials do not achieve any of the levels created by the new standard for a given agent, the product&amp;#39;s technical information label should show this clearly.&amp;nbsp;The reader must understand that the material is not classified to the standard for the particular agent in question.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When working with chemicals, wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and protective clothing, can greatly reduce the risk of injury caused by chemical reactions and burns. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently announced that it would conduct a survey of private employers to help the agency better create new rules and regulations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Baseline Survey of Safety and Health Practices will be sent out to as many as 19,000 employers and will ask them about how they manage workplace health and safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The survey is being sent to employers of varying sizes in any of the industries that are regulated by OSHA. Some of the questions on the survey will focus on whether a safety management system is in place, who is in charge of safety in the company, whether inspections are performed on a yearly basis and what kind of hazards exist in their business.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The survey may also ask about what type of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; are required and used by each business.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Participation in the survey is voluntary and its results will be compiled by Eastern Research Group. The data collection phase is expected to be completed by August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA said that the results of the survey may help it create better regulations and will also help with its compliance assistance efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new slide presentation from the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is designed to provide &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; tips to residential construction workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The compliance program, which is available on OSHA&amp;#39;s website, covers a variety of topics, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and workplace procedures that should be used to prevent on-site accidents. The agency reports that falls are the leading cause of death for construction workers in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, the slide show describes some of the most effective fall protection strategies that are used in the U.S., such as the use of a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt;, or the installation of a guardrail or a net.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Managers of work sites may be interested in viewing the slide show to ensure that their employees are using the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and following the best procedures. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are legally responsible for setting and enforcing safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Companies that promote employee safety are more likely to prosper in the long run, according to an executive with an Ohio-based workers&amp;#39; compensation agency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Randy Jones, the senior vice president of CompManagement, recently told Smart Business that employers should take workplace safety very seriously. By providing adequate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and regular training sessions, he said that companies can avoid unnecessary workers&amp;#39; compensation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to Jones, claim costs are one of the three major factors that determine an employer&amp;#39;s annual premium with the Ohio Bureau of Workers&amp;#39; Compensation. Thus, he recommended that companies should ensure that they are following state and federal laws.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These procedures depend on the industry. For example, employees who work with dangerous machinery or hazardous materials should receive lockout/tagout training. Individuals who spend time at a high elevation may need to wear a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No matter what the company&amp;#39;s line of work, every employer should have a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; on hand, Jones told the media outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, at least one first-aid kit should be accessible at small work sites. Multiple kits should be provided at larger operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new study sheds light on the importance of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; at a work site.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report, which will be published in the July 2011 edition of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, suggests that U.S. employers should take more precautions to prevent work-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). The study revealed that agriculture, forestry and fishing industries had the highest rates between 2003 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Researchers based their findings on data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injury (CFOI). The leading causes of fatal TBIs on worksites were motor vehicle accidents and falls.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With limited resources available for occupational safety and health programs, the identification and targeting of high-risk populations, including older workers, should be a priority for industry,&amp;quot; said Hope Tiesman, lead investigator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers may want to consider revamping their &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; standards and stocking up on &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that workers do not experience TBIs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new report reveals that 2009 was the safest year for the trucking industry since the federal government began tracking job-related fatalities in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the American Trucking Association, the rate of truck-involved deaths on U.S. highways was 1.17 per 100 million miles in 2009. This is a 14 percent decrease from the 1.37 rate in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ATA Chairman Barbara Windsor said that the trucking industry has made significant strides in decreasing work-related injuries and deaths. Those efforts are highlighted in the organization&amp;#39;s 18-point progressive safety agenda and programs such as Share the Road and America&amp;#39;s Road Team.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is great news, not just for the trucking industry but for the entire motoring public,&amp;quot; ATA President and CEO Bill Graves said. &amp;quot;These improvements are a testament to the commitment to safety made by the trucking industry, the federal government, and trucking&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement partners.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By providing training for drivers, safer vehicles, and updating &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, employers have reduced risks for drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;According to Industrial Safety and Hygiene News (ISHN), it is critical that companies know how to prepare for a National Emphasis Program (NEP) inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Michael Taylor, a former legal representative for the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, says that preparing for these inspection visits can help an organization save money and avoid negative publicity. Employers may want to make sure their &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is in place and operating efficiently and that employees are adequately trained on lockout/tagout procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NEPs were originally established by the U.S. Department of Labor&amp;#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1985. They allow the federal agency to leverage its limited resources to focus on particular industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Taylor recommended that employers perform an audit of the expected walk-around route with OSHA officials. This gives companies the opportunity to fix some things that might be overlooked, such as workers not using&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Recently, OSHA issued a new directive establishing a NEP for the primary metals industries. The goal of the initiative is to reduce harmful chemical and physical hazards at work sites that manufacture metal products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new report indicates that workplace safety continues to improve in the state of Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study, which was released by the Department of Business and Consumer Services, reveals that Oregon&amp;#39;s private sector workers experienced work-related injuries and illnesses at a rate of 4.4 for every 100 full-time employees in 2009. This is the lowest figure ever recorded in the Beaver State, and a significant improvement from the 1999 rate - seven injured or ill workers for every 100 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the highest incidence rate was recorded by the transportation and warehousing industries, while the finance and insurance industries were the lowest. Approximately 53 percent of the 48,304 cases recorded in 2009 resulted in lost work time, including days away from work, restricted activity or transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The trend suggests that employers are putting more emphasis on installing the newest &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid state or federal fines, many companies are requiring their workers to use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Although Oregon&amp;#39;s workplace safety initiative is seeing progress, the Beaver State still falls behind the national average. Based on the North American Industry Classification System, 3.6 out of every 100 private sector employees in the U.S. suffer a work-related illness or injury.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Several industries, such as the construction and healthcare sectors, require some of their employees to be equipped with adequate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; to prevent inhalation of harmful contaminants. Companies that provide respiratory masks to their workers are more likely to avoid safety violations and protect their staff from injuries and long-term disease.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/150-20093/NS-Respiratory-7210-N95-Disposable-Particulate-Respirator" target="_blank"&gt;NS&amp;#39;s 7210 N95 Disposable Particulate Respirator&lt;/a&gt; is a popular model used by many companies throughout the nation.

                &lt;p&gt;Dangerous particulates are prevalent at many work sites throughout the country. Employers may want to consider stocking up on additional &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; because protecting workers from irritating particulates is a vital component of maintaining occupational health.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Northern Safety offers an affordable option for companies looking to protect their staff while saving a few bucks. The 8210 N95 Disposable Particulate Respirator is a popular selection among crews involved with grinding, sanding and bagging.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These comfortable respirators provide a minimum 95 percent filter efficiency against solid and non-oil based aerosol particulates. In addition, they feature an adjustable noseclip with a foam strip that helps reduce fogging on &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The 8210 respirator is equipped with staple-free headband attachments and is made from material that provides comfort in all weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this product , although approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, is not recommended for asbestos and sandblasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers (&lt;span data-scayt_word="ASSE" data-scaytid="2"&gt;ASSE&lt;/span&gt;) recently sent federal lawmakers draft legislation that details needed reforms in the occupational safety and health law.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The organization&amp;#39;s bill, called Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health Protections in the 100th Year Act of 2011, is designed to help the &lt;span data-scayt_word="U.S" data-scaytid="1"&gt;U.S&lt;/span&gt;. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (&lt;span data-scayt_word="NIOSH" data-scaytid="4"&gt;NIOSH&lt;/span&gt;) improve their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-scayt_word="ASSE" data-scaytid="3"&gt;ASSE&lt;/span&gt; President Darryl Hill said the draft builds on previous policies while addressing what is being neglected by existing laws. The legislation was sent on June 10 to the chairman and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions as well as the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some of the proposed changes are updating permissible exposure limits, increasing penalties for those responsible for an unsafe work culture and encouraging collaborative rulemaking within a company.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Efforts of employers and our members, OSHA&amp;rsquo;s regulatory oversight, and the research and support for education that &lt;span data-scayt_word="NIOSH" data-scaytid="5"&gt;NIOSH&lt;/span&gt; directs have been highly successful,&amp;quot; Hill said. &amp;quot;But no one believes workers are safe enough. No one believes that we cannot do better. Let&amp;rsquo;s do better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One of the most important ways to improve workplace safety is through the use of quality &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A top-ranking official with the National Safety Council (NSC) has been invited to join a group responsible for identifying major safety and health challenges in the manufacturing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Jim Johnson, vice president of Workplace Safety Initiatives for NSC, will serve as a member of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA). The group has been tasked with developing an agenda over the next decade to address safety and health concerns among manufacturing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workplace interventions are commonly designed to help businesses identify problem areas that require improvement, such as a need for new &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; or the implementation of employee training sessions covering &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security" class="dnautolink"&gt;lockout tagout&lt;/a&gt; procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Created in 1996, NORA conducts research and designs a framework to improve workplace safety throughout the nation. The group&amp;#39;s Manufacturing Sector Council collaborates with employers, employees, government agencies, insurers, and trade associations to determine the most pressing issues in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I look forward to working with other members of the Manufacturing Sector to find solutions to the leading manufacturing safety challenges,&amp;quot; Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Ohio Bureau of Workers&amp;#39; Compensation (BWC) recognized National Safety Month by adding two free safety courses for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the News-Messenger, the courses - which are designed by the agency&amp;#39;s Division of Safety and Hygiene - focus on industrial ventilation and construction safety practices. The two courses add to the more than 60 courses offered to Ohio employees at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The ventilation class provides hands-on training for addressing common ventilation system problems. The construction safety review addresses accident analysis, safety program management, hazard communication as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;BWC&amp;#39;s Division of Safety and Hygiene is an outstanding resource for Ohio employers seeking consultation on the most effective safety practices that support the success of their business by protecting their workforce and minimizing costs associated with workers&amp;#39; compensation claims,&amp;quot; BWC CEO Stephen Buehrer said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;National Safety Month is sponsored by the National Safety Council (NSC) and recognized every June. Each week of the month has a theme bringing attention to a variety of important safety officials.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Beginning on June 19, 2011 the NSC will shed light on slips, trips, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently announced it will &amp;quot;phase in&amp;quot; new enforcement rules regarding &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; regulations on residential construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the International Business Times, the agency started enforcing the new standards on June 16, 2011. It will gradually implement the regulations through September 15, 2011. This will give contractors and inspectors time to adjust to the new regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers who wish to ensure better fall protection at their job sites should purchase &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/166-26979/NS-Fall-Protection-Full-Body-Fall-Harness-Lanyard-Combo" target="_blank"&gt;NS&amp;#39;s full body harness and lanyard combo&lt;/a&gt;, which complies with OSHA and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The harness includes a sliding back D-ring, lanyard keeper, and back side web torso strap. The 6-foot long lanyard is equipped with a shock absorber and tubular webbing. The universal size of NS&amp;#39;s full-body harness fits most individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition, the harness&amp;#39; stress-inducing safety tabs let the wearer know when the harness has been involved in a fall and should be removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NS&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt; could save lives. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that falls are the most common cause of workplace deaths in the construction industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;16 mil latex &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; are ideal for extreme environments in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Durable latex construction resists most tearing and ripping. In addition, the snug fit allows for a tight grip and little chance that foreign substances will contact the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/122-23431/Microflex-SafeGrip-16-Mil-Powder-Free-11-1-2-Disposable-Latex-Gloves?skw=Microflex%20SafeGrip" target="_blank"&gt;Microflex SafeGrip&amp;#39;s Powder-Free Disposable Latex Gloves&lt;/a&gt; are a popular choice to ensure workplace safety. Measuring 11 &amp;frac12; inches in length, these gloves have been manufactured using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-accepted materials.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The latex is 16 mil thick and provides reliable hand protection against cuts and abrasions, and when working with potentially harmful materials. They are four times thicker than the traditional latex exam gloves used in a doctor&amp;#39;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;SafeGrip&amp;#39;s extended cuff protects the wrist and forearm. In addition, this glove is designed with textured fingers to give the user optimum gripping capabilities on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When work produces intense pressure and strain on your hands, you can rely on these gloves for excellent protection.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;With harvest season approaching, the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) will offer health and safety tips for farmers and farm workers during National Farm Safety and Health Week, taking place September 18-25, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics show that roughly 1,783,000 farm workers were employed full-time in the U.S. in 2009. That same year, 440 farmers and workers died from work-related injuries. Each day, an average of 243 agricultural industry workers suffered injuries that led to lost time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ASSE said that one of the most important things for farmers to remember is to be fully educated about on-site equipment. With tractor overturns accounting for more than 90 deaths on average every year, learning about equipment and attending farm safety workshops can help to reduce this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Conducting regular inspections and installing Rollover Protection Structures (ROPS) are also important. The use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;can also greatly reduce the risk for farming and harvesting injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are few places that mold won&amp;#39;t eventually grow under the right circumstances. Many workplaces are unfortunately home to these conditions, making mold a serious threat for many employees. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, some of the workers with the greatest risk of mold exposure include farmers, dairy workers, loggers, bakers, mill workers, carpenters, greenhouse employees, winemakers, and furniture repair professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactions to mold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that as many as 50 million people in the United States are allergic to airborne particulates. Mold spores account for a lot of this irritation, so it is important for workers to recognize the symptoms of an allergic reaction to mold. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Sneezing&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Runny nose&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Eye irritation&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Coughing&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Congestion&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Worsening of asthma symptoms&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Dermatitis (skin rashes)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees who have these symptoms should inform a supervisor or manager. People who are particularly susceptible to mold include older people, those with existing respiratory illnesses, individuals with weakened immune systems, those with surgery in their recent history, and people taking steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding mold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Identifying mold isn&amp;#39;t very difficult. Most people will recognize it immediately as a woolly discoloration growing in a dark and moist area. Black patches on these surfaces are usually mildew, a very common type of mold.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mold can also be located by its distinctive musty, earthy odor.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing risks after water damage occurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                The best way to reduce mold-related risks after a spill or flood at a workplace is by preventing it from growing in the first place. When water is spilled or floods an area, employees should quickly remove it by repairing drainage infrastructure or using a wet-dry vacuum cleaner. This must be done within 24 to 48 hours, or before mold has a chance to begin growing. Once the bulk of the water has been removed, fans and other ventilation devices should be used to help with additional drying.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wet surfaces that won&amp;#39;t retain water should be cleaned thoroughly with water and detergent. Any porous items that have been wet for more than 48 hours need to be thrown out immediately. A number of porous materials can&amp;#39;t be cleaned and will become moldy once they&amp;#39;ve been immersed in water. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Carpeting and carpet padding&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Upholstery&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Wallpaper&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Drywall&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Floor and ceiling tiles&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Insulation&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Some clothing&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Leather&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Paper&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Wood&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the right equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Areas that have been exposed to mold should be approached with caution, especially by employees who know or suspect that they have mold allergies. Disposable respirators will help protect workers&amp;#39; respiratory systems from mold spores.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mold spores can also cause eye and skin irritation. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as goggles, gloves, and protective clothing are important to wear in places that have recently flooded. Provide these items to any workers who are at risk for mold exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When cleaning up mold, many different detergents and cleansers can be used. While they are both effective on their own, bleach and ammonia should never be mixed. Together, they create a harmful, poisonous gas. Instruct workers to use dish detergent or other chemicals that have been approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Taking steps to prevent excess moisture and reduce mold growth in your place of business may include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Keeping humidity levels between 40 and 60 percent&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Ensuring proper ventilation&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Prompt repair and cleaning after discovering a roof or window leak&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Adding mold inhibitors to paints before painting&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Using mold-killing products to clean bathrooms, entrances, and exits where moisture and water tend to accumulate&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Monitoring and maintaining entrance matting during rainy periods and winter months, making sure to keep the area as clean and dry as possible&lt;br /&gt;

                With proper training, vigilant workers, and the right equipment, companies can minimize mold at their workplaces. Mold is best dealt with long before it takes root, so take extra care to prevent water, moisture, and flooding from wreaking havoc on your workplace. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued its annual plan for inspections to help enforce regulations for high-hazard, non-construction workplaces where the highest rates of injury and illness are reported. The announcement came as a part of the Site-Specific Targeting (SST) 2011 program, which will help the agency direct enforcement resources to workplaces with the highest rates of injuries and illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program is OSHA&amp;#39;s primary inspection plan in workplaces outside the construction industry that have more than 20 workers present. The workplaces identified had above-average injury and illness rates, compared to baseline data compiled in a large survey of 80,000 work sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By focusing our inspection resources on employers in high hazard industries who endanger their employees, we can prevent injuries and illnesses and save lives,&amp;quot; said OSHA&amp;#39;s Assistant Secretary of Labor David Michaels. &amp;quot;Through the SST program we examine all major aspects of these operations to determine the effectiveness of their safety and health efforts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The notice has three major differences from the 2010 Site-Specific Targeting program, which include using CY 2009 injury and illness data to compile lists, changing the establishment employee size from 40 to 20, and incorporating an evaluation study to measure the program&amp;#39;s impact on future compliance with OSHA standards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Floods can occur both indoors and outdoors and pose a number of health risks. Overworked sanitation systems can reduce an area&amp;#39;s water purification capabilities, mold and mildew can increase exponentially, dangerous chemicals are easily spread when flood waters rise, and wild animals often become displaced by flooding. Many workers end up in close contact with rising water, so employers should be sure to teach their workers about the basics of working in and around flood water.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA cautions that the most significant health risks posed by flooding have to do with bacterial infections and diseases that thrive in murky standing water. In particular, e. coli and salmonella are commonly found in flooded areas. Workers should monitor themselves and others for symptoms of these diseases, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, and fever. Employees suffering from an infection should seek medical attention and warn employers and coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes are found in swamps, marshes, and other areas full of standing water. These insects are attracted to flooded areas and will infest these areas in large numbers. Mosquitoes can spread encephalitis and West Nile virus, so workers in flooded areas should wear bug repellent and keep their arms and legs covered at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Above all, workers who spend time in flood regions, or have to help to repair flooded areas, should wash their hands often. This should be done with clean water and soap. If water systems are not functional, bottled water is acceptable. Water that has been boiled for 10 minutes will also work, as will chemically disinfected water. This can be done by adding five drops of household bleach for every gallon of water and letting it stand for 30 minutes afterwards. Never drink this water or use it to brush teeth or clean eating utensils.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Animals that usually live in the wilderness, such as raccoons, possums, or badgers may be driven out of their burrows by heavy rain and flooding. Be careful exploring basements, garages, warehouses, and other structures that have been hit by heavy flooding. They may have become temporary homes for these animals, which could be hurt, sick, or may simply become frightened and attack.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers should always provide proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that will protect workers in flooded areas from chemical spills and infections. This includes work boots, rubber gloves, disposable respirators, and other personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On September 15, 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) awarded $10.7 million in Susan Harwood Training Grants to 37 new recipients and 32 returning participants, including several nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The grants support programs to provide in-person, hands-on training and education for workers and employers involved in industries with high injury and fatality rates. It will also provide training for those who may not be literate, young workers, and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No one should ever suffer injury or death for the sake of a paycheck,&amp;quot; Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis stated. &amp;quot;This education and training will help ensure that every worker returns home safely at the end of his or her shift.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s Susan Harwood Training Grant Program awards organizations on a competitive basis.&amp;nbsp;Solicitation for the program is a function of Congressional budgetary approval and appropriation by the Department of Labor (DOL).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The grant program provides employers with resources and information about unsafe working conditions, mitigation strategies, and their responsibilities. By receiving training, organizations will learn how to better enforce proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and site-specific safety programs. The training aims to teach employers to recognize, avoid, and prevent hazards in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;An alert has been issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), based on a similar notice recently issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), warning employers and workers of the risks associated with using certain Eaton/Cutler-Hammer molded-case circuit breakers that were improperly rebuilt by a third party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The circuit breakers may appear to be new or properly rebuilt, but a third-party rebuilder changed them from the original Eaton/Cutler-Hammer design. These breakers may be identified by model numbers E2K and E2KM. The breakers may have an actual rating of 600 volts AC (VAC) or less, but are labeled as 1,000 VAC and may contain incorrect parts that can cause the breaker to malfunction. The number of breakers incorrectly rebuilt and the locations where they have been integrated are not known at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alert warns that improper handling of these incorrectly rebuilt circuit breakers could lead to arc flash, electrocution, fire, shock, burns, and explosions. There have been reports that they may lack proper safety features such as grounding and fault protection, which has led to malfunctions and put workers at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA recognizes these circuit breakers are intended for use in mining operations and that employers performing tunneling operations may use the same breakers. OSHA suggests that a qualified person should remove any known, possibly defective breaker from service and report any malfunctions to the agency, so further information can be attained in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The hazards presented by the incorrectly rebuilt circuit breakers can be made less severe if the proper steps are taken and the appropriate protective equipment is worn. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; may greatly reduce the risk of injury associated with the malfunction of the breakers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Four companies were recognized by the National Safety Council (NSC) and given the Safety Leadership Award in August, 2011. The companies were honored for reporting at least five consecutive years of zero occupational injuries or illnesses that resulted in days lost from work or death.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The awards were given as a part of the NSC&amp;#39;s Safety Motivation and Recognition Award Program. The program works to recognize companies, units, and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Work injuries cost America $138 billion in 2008, with an estimated 4,303 accidental work deaths. If companies can inspire safer behavior and cultivate a safety-oriented work environment, they can reduce workplace injuries and fatalities, and ultimately improve their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The NSC has long been an integral part of saving lives and preventing injuries in the workplace, in homes, and on the road by providing leadership, education, advocacy, and research to continue that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order for companies to implement solid health and safety programs, proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is essential. Site-specific systems, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death by tailoring a program to the hazards present in the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Winter weather is largely to blame for the increased threat of highway and road accidents during the colder months. Workers can be injured during trips to and from a worksite or while carrying out other tasks, so employers should stress the importance of being vigilant on the road. The U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;#39;s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that each year, there are an average of 583,400 crashes and 181,300 injuries due to snow, sleet, hail, and slush on the road. Consider the following tips for educating staff members about these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three Ps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) advocates that employers teach their workers to follow the rule of the three Ps when driving in the winter. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Prepare: prepare for the trip before it begins&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Protect: be sure that normal safety requirements are met&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Prevent: avoid actions that increase the chances of an accident&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                While the condition and functionality of vehicles need to be guaranteed no matter the time of year, there are certain features that are particularly important in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Windshield wipers are crucial for clearing falling snow and melted ice out of a driver&amp;#39;s field of vision. Wipers need to be checked much more frequently in the winter, as they are key to preventing accidents. Damaged or worn wipers need to be replaced immediately, or a vehicle shouldn&amp;#39;t be driven.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All windows need to be clear of ice and snow before a trip begins, so an ice scraper should be present in all vehicles during the winter. A scraper should come with a brush to make it easier to remove loose snow. Wiper fluid is an important backup supply in case ice begins to build on a windshield while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Tire treads need to be in good condition to drive on icy or snow-covered roads. Tires with treads that are worn down or bald should be replaced as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some supplies should be kept in cars, trucks, and vans for the duration of the winter. They include an extra supply of antifreeze, a flashlight, jumper cables, a snow shovel, a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;, and blankets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Safety protocols should always be followed by drivers, but extra vigilance is necessary to drive during the winter. This means that seat belts should always be worn and any additional requirements for trucks, backhoes, and cargo transportation vehicles should be strictly observed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Drivers who are inexperienced with winter road conditions should practice steering on ice and snow, preferably in the company of an experienced driver. Employers can facilitate this in a parking lot or empty area where it is safe to improve a worker&amp;#39;s ability to stop on short notice and use anti-lock brakes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers can help to make the identification of broken-down or disabled vehicles easier. Bright, reflective tape can be placed on antennae as well as the bumpers and hoods of company cars and trucks. This will help prevent them from being hit by other drivers when pulled to the side of the road. In these situations, workers should also activate their hazard flashers and activate the interior dome lights for maximum visibility in snowstorms or when sleet is falling. Flares, warning triangles, booster cables, and other emergency roadside &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; should be carried in company vehicles for quick use in the event of an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Prevent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Driving in the winter means that the distance between vehicles on the road should be increased to reduce the risk of skidding and brakes locking up. Additionally, all cars and trucks should be driven much more slowly than they normally would be in ideal conditions, no matter the speed limit that&amp;#39;s posted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy for workers to become tired or fatigued in the wintertime. Shoveling snow and walking on icy surfaces adds to this exhaustion, which can be made even worse by the stress of careful winter driving. Workers should avoid getting behind the wheel of a vehicle if they are overtired or exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions and preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                If you&amp;#39;re an employer whose workers are required to drive in the winter, purchase extra &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; in case a vehicle breaks down or is in an accident. Safety vests can help identify employees as they assess these situations, while &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and warm &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; can help when making repairs or while waiting for help. In addition, avoid sending staff members out to drive without first making sure that they have warm clothes in case their vehicle breaks down on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Educate workers and outfit them with the best personal protective equipment to be certain that they&amp;#39;re safe while on the road this winter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Reduce potential threats and risks to your workers when they&amp;#39;re driving in winter conditions. As an employer, make yourself aware of worker driving abilities and limitations, and prepare workers and their vehicles with the right equipment in the event of a roadside emergency. Sleet, blizzards, heavy snow, black ice, and ice storms are all hazards of winter driving &amp;ndash; remember the three Ps: Prepare, Protect, and Prevent.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new report issued by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) stated that public fire departments around the country responded to 1,331,500 fires in 2010, marking a slight decrease from the year before and the lowest number in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report, titled &amp;quot;Fire Loss in the United States During 2010,&amp;quot; found that fires were the cause of an estimated 3,120 civilian deaths, 17,720 injuries related to fires, and more than $11.5 billion in property damage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;About 482,000 structural fires were reported in 2010, compared to the peak number of 1,098,000 in 1977, the year NFPA began the annual report.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have made tremendous progress in reducing the fire problem in the United States since we began looking at these numbers in the late 70s,&amp;quot; said Lorraine Carli, vice president of communications for NFPA. &amp;quot;But this report shows us that more must be done to bring the numbers down even further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The annual survey is conducted to estimate the overall severity of the fire problem in the U.S. It is broken down by general occupancy, region, and size of community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As firefighters battle blazes in the U.S.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as fire extinguishers and smoke detectors&amp;nbsp;can help protect them from injuries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently teamed up with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to develop a new guide titled &amp;quot;Nail Gun Safety &amp;ndash; A Guide for Construction Contractors,&amp;quot; which aims to help employers and workers on construction sites prevent work-related nail gun injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nail gun injuries are responsible for approximately 37,000 emergency room visits annually. In some cases, workers have died from their injuries,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;This document will help construction employers make necessary changes to improve nail gun safety and protect their workers from preventable injuries and death.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Although it is a relatively easy tool to operate that is known to increase productivity on construction sites, there has been no shortage of internal and external bodily injury reports related to nail guns. Most are the result of unintended firing of the nail gun, nails that bounce off, rather than penetrate, a surface, and the disabling of the gun&amp;#39;s safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the guidelines, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are highlighted, including safety shoes, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, hearing protection, and high impact eye protection such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; or goggles.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;At the recent National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) news conference, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Thomas R. Frieden joined the discussion, which called for all Americans to get vaccinated against the flu before the upcoming season.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the H1N1 flu pandemic blew through the country, leading to thousands of deaths and even more hospitalizations. On September 21, 2011, some of the country&amp;#39;s top health and medical experts convened in Washington, D.C., to determine whether or not the country is prepared for the upcoming season.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Several medical experts, including Dr. Frieden, met at the conference and conferred with many representatives from academia, government, and health professional societies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Topics discussed included the amount and availability of this year&amp;#39;s vaccine, as well as the various options for receiving the vaccine. This year, it can be administered with a much smaller needle, or even in the form of a nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are too many illnesses and deaths from influenza each year,&amp;quot; Frieden said. &amp;quot;Everyone over 6 months should get a flu shot this year and every year.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every year the flu causes an estimated 200,000 hospitalizations and an average of 26,000 deaths. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also released guidelines for employers to follow in the event of an influenza pandemic, including encouraging workers to wash their hands frequently, and to avoid touching their noses, mouths, and eyes. OSHA urges employees to wear certain &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;, such as surgical masks, goggles, faceshields, or respirators, to help prevent the spread of infection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Workplace emergency exit routes are not only helpful, but required for safe evacuation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued design and construction requirements for all emergency exit routes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA states than an exit route is a &amp;quot;continuous and unobstructed path of exit travel from any point within a workplace to a place of safety,&amp;quot; and can be broken down into three separate parts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The exit access, exit, and exit discharge points must all be clearly established, with at least two routes available to all employees and personnel during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Basic requirements of exit routes include placing them as far apart as possible from each other in the event one is blocked, ensuring that the route is a permanent fixture in the workplace, and separating each exit with fire resistant materials. A route must lead directly to a street, refuge area, open space, or public way with access to the outside, and must be large enough to accommodate the likely amount of people using the exit in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In case of a fire emergency, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as fire extinguishers, a burn &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;, and fire and burn blankets should be available at all workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released two reports that detail outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with recreational swimming and drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The reports, titled &amp;quot;Surveillance for Waterborne Disease Outbreaks and Other Health Events Associated with Recreational Water&amp;mdash;United States, 2007-2008&amp;rdquo; and &amp;quot;Surveillance for Waterborne Disease Outbreaks Associated with Drinking Water&amp;mdash;United States, 2007-2008,&amp;quot; give facts and information on preventing and treating these illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The data states that from January 2007 to December 2008, the most recent period for which data on the subject has been collected, 134 outbreaks were associated with recreational water, while 36 were linked to drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many strategies are highlighted to keep waterborne diseases to a minimum, including good swimmer hygiene. The report states that swimmers should thoroughly wash with soap before entering swimming pools, and there should be an appropriate number of clean, functioning, and well-stocked bathroom facilities near swimming pools, interactive fountains, spas, or wading pools.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The 2007-2008 outbreaks associated with drinking water led to 4,128 illnesses and three deaths, with more than 50 percent of the reports associated with untreated or inadequately treated ground water.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the event of an outbreak, cleaning up contaminated areas while using the proper&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including footwear, clothing, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, respirators, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; may help to contain the spread of the disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking to give employees the best protection from hearing loss, use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/117-1455/Howard-Leight-by-Sperian-MAX-Pre-Shaped-Corded-Foam-Disposable-Ear-Plugs-NRR-33?skw=Howard%20Leight%20by%20Sperian%20MAX%C2%AE%20Pre-Shaped%20Corded%20Foam%20Disposable%20Ear%20Plugs"&gt;Howard Leight by Sperian MAX&amp;reg; Pre-Shaped Corded Foam Disposable &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Ear Plugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These plugs are extremely comfortable and easy to use, so staff members will want to take advantage of the protection they offer. They also have a noise reduction rating (NRR) of 33 dB, meaning that they offer a very high level of hearing protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As the world&amp;#39;s most popular polyurethane foam ear plug, they have a number of important features. One is the cord that attaches them. This makes them much easier to keep track of throughout the day to help control loss. To ensure that your &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; are always in a place where you can reach them, purchase Howard Leight by Sperian MAX&amp;reg; Pre-Shaped Corded Foam Disposable &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Ear Plugs&lt;/span&gt; for use in factories, on construction sites, at warehouses, or any other workplace subject to loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The contoured bell shape of these plugs makes them incredibly easy to insert and reduces their tendency to back out of the ear canal. Workers won&amp;#39;t have to constantly readjust them - they&amp;#39;ll simply stay in place for the duration of work. Because of their polyurethane foam construction, they offer maximum comfort for long-term wear.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Use Howard Leight by Sperian MAX&amp;reg; Pre-Shaped Corded Foam Disposable &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Ear Plugs&lt;/span&gt; to save money and comply with regulations requiring workers to use hearing protection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In an effort to reduce the likelihood of injuries and accidents, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) Director Michael R. Bromwich recently proposed a rule to improve safety during oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. The rule comes as the department works to enhance U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proposal expands upon the Workplace Safety Rule of October 2010, and will add employee training, strengthen auditing procedures, and help to engage personnel in safety management.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We must remain fully focused on continually strengthening safety standards to protect workers and to reduce the risk of accidents and spills,&amp;quot; Secretary Salazar said in a statement. &amp;quot;Our goal is to ensure that safety is front and center every day, for every worker, on every project.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proposed Safety and Environmental Management Systems (SEMS) rule is designed to reduce the amount of human and organizational errors that result in work-related accidents and offshore oil spills. These programs apply to all oil and natural gas activities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Worker safety can also be improved by incorporating &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, into daily activities on the worksite. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On August 8, 2011, the International &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/span&gt; Association&amp;#39;s (ISEA&amp;#39;s) proposal to revise the industry standard on high-visibility public safety vests became available for public comment and review. The revision is directed towards the ANSI/ISEA 207 standard published in 2006, which specified requirements for protective vests for emergency services personnel, EMT&amp;#39;s, and other public safety workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The specifications include performance requirements for color and retroreflection, and also suggest how to configure high-visibility materials when constructing high-visibility safety vests. The revision provides test methods to ensure a minimum level of visibility can be maintained during ongoing care procedures .&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the update, clarification of requirements regarding identification panels, logos, and lettering are made, as these are important factors in the public service community. Also included in the revision are useful service life guidelines for high-visibility garments being worn by highway workers. These guidelines were incorporated from the Federal Highway Administration&amp;#39;s current standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Comments concerning the draft were accepted by ISEA until September 19, 2011.&amp;nbsp;The revisions will be sent through a consensus panel that will decide if the new standard will be submitted to ANSI for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Currently, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has regulations that specify that high visibility garments and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are required for highway workers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The United States Fire Administration (USFA) has released its annual report titled &amp;quot;Firefighter Fatalities in the United States in 2010,&amp;quot; which details the 2010 study conducted by USFA on the deaths of on-duty firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In total, there were 87 firefighter fatalities in 31 states in 2010, resulting from 83 fatal incidents. The report noted 2010 was the second-consecutive year that saw significantly lower firefighter deaths across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the previous six years, from 2004 to 2009, an average of 112 firefighters died every year while on duty, with Illinois ranking highest with nine fatalities. New York and Ohio shared the second-highest number of deaths, with eight fatalities each.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the report, the nature of fatal injuries was detailed, suggesting heart attack and trauma were the most prevalent causes of death while on the job, accounting for 57.5 percent and 23 percent of fatalities, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;USFA has tracked firefighter fatality data for 34 years, focusing on specific problems to continue to reduce the rate of firefighter fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Help reduce risk in your workplace with education, fire drills, and reliable &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/fire-safety-equipment" target="_blank"&gt;fire extinguishers&lt;/a&gt;, smoke alarms, and fire escape ladders. Burn blankets and burn first aid kits kept at your facility or worksite, and carried in vehicles will help keep you and your workers prepared for a fire emergency.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently issued a new hazard alert that discusses the risks of working in grain storage bins. The alert warns that workers in the grain handling industry are at risk for being exposed to life-threatening hazards, such as suffocation from engulfment and entrapment, fires and explosions from the buildup of grain dust, crushing injuries and amputations from grain handling equipment,&amp;nbsp;and fall risks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The release cites a report issued by Purdue University that found that 51 workers were engulfed by grain stored in bins in 2010, resulting in 26 deaths, the highest number recorded for one year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Suffocation from engulfment is the leading cause of death in grain bins and the number of tragedies continues to climb,&amp;quot; Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels said in a release. &amp;quot;They can be avoided if owners and operators use well-known safety measures that are proven to prevent workers from being killed or seriously injured.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alert provides measures that aim to save grain handlers&amp;#39; lives, including specific training for all workers and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; system such as a body harness and lifeline, or a boatswain&amp;#39;s chair that can be used to pull a worker from a storage bin. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced it plans to reopen the rulemaking process to extend the comment period on what standards for reporting and recording work-related injuries and illnesses are required by law. The comment period has been extended per request from a stakeholder. The new deadline is October 28, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new proposal states that employers would need to report any work-related deaths and all in-patient hospitalizations to OSHA within eight hours, while any amputation that results from a workplace injury must be reported within 24 hours. Current standards require employers to report all hospitalizations and fatalities of three or more employees within eight hours,&amp;nbsp;and reporting work-related amputations is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA has also suggested updating Appendix A of the recordkeeping rule that lists industries exempt from the recordkeeping rule due to their relatively low rates of injury and illness reports.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the final count of fatal work injuries across the country in 2009 was 4,551, up from initial reports of 4,340.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To decrease injuries and illnesses in the workplace, OSHA requires employers to enforce the use of many&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers ASSE has announced the approval of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/ASSE Z590.3 standard, &amp;quot;Prevention through Design: Addressing Occupational Risks in the Design &amp;amp; Redesign Processes.&amp;quot; This standard details groundbreaking ways to prevent risks and injuries through design concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The standard provides guidance on how to integrate preventative design concepts into an existing occupational safety and health management system. These guidances were written to be used in any occupational setting.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of the key elements of this standard is that it provides guidance for &amp;lsquo;life-cycle&amp;rsquo; assessments and a design model that balances environmental and occupational safety and health goals over the life span of a facility, process, or product,&amp;quot; ASSE said in a recent release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The standard discusses the avoidance, elimination, reduction, or control of safety and health hazards found in the workplace, and risks that are present from the initial planning and specifications of the design and redesign process, where the opportunities are greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Controls in the standards include the necessity for supplying personal protective equipment (PPE), which may include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, faceshields, respirators, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and hearing protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In order for occupational safety and health to advance, standards must be provided to set regulations and achieve a higher level of excellence. By following the new Prevention Through Design guidelines, occupational settings can improve safety and quality of work for all employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has issued a new standard, titled &amp;quot;ISO 26800:2011, Ergonomics &amp;ndash; General approach, principles and concepts,&amp;quot; which aims to increase the use of ergonomics in common appliances and products.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;From computer keyboards to parking lot ticket machines, a wide range of products should not pose unreasonable difficulties and risks to operate, the organization says. The new standard was created to increase the well-being of users and improve a system&amp;#39;s overall performance, including common products.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A substantial number of ergonomics standards have been developed to cover specific issues and different application domains, but this standard will serve as an umbrella reference for all such standards and provide an integrated framework bringing together the basic principles and concepts of ergonomics in one document,&amp;quot; said Georg Kr&amp;auml;mer, Chair of the ISO Technical Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The standard was created to improve safety, accessibility, usability and performance, while at the same time developing a safe environment for human health and well-being.&amp;nbsp;It was written to be used by designers, project managers, ergonomists, managers, consumers, procurers, and workers to fill the specific goal of optimizing tasks, equipment, services, and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The application of ergonomics in the workplace can be supplemented with various &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that also help ensure a safe and productive environment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On September 27, 2011, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) announced it had released the NFPA 56(PS), Standard for Fire and Explosion Prevention During Cleaning and Purging of Flammable Gas Piping Systems, 2012 Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new standards prohibit the use of flammable gas as a means for cleaning the interior of piping systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is an example of the critical role NFPA plays in providing codes and standards,&amp;quot; said NFPA President James M. Shannon. &amp;quot;Our ability to bring together the right people at the right time and to facilitate a consensus process in very short order resulted in a standard that will save lives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to the discontinuation of flammable gas used as a cleaning agent and examples of procedures for purging gas pipes based on the new requirements, the standard also includes details on cleaning new or repaired pipes, putting new pipes into service, and removing existing piping.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new standard also requires that written safety procedures be developed, which must be validated by safety experts before they can be put into use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the event of a fire or explosion, companies should have proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; on hand, including fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and escape ladders.&amp;nbsp;Always be prepared by educating all employees about fire escape procedures and evacuation routes&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On September 28, 2011, U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Secretary Ray LaHood announced he has released $5 million in emergency funds for New York roads and bridges. These funds are to be immediately available to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to help repair roads and bridges that were damaged after Hurricane Irene.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hurricane Irene left New York residents with an enormous cleanup job and limited mobility because of damaged roads and bridges,&amp;quot; said Secretary LaHood. &amp;quot;This emergency relief funding will help the state cover the costs to make repairs and restore the routes critical to communities hurt by the storm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The flooding in New York began on August 26, and caused substantial damage to roads and bridges. NYSDOT has agreed to use the quick release funds to continue emergency repair projects in 31 counties across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The estimated overall damage to highways under federal jurisdiction will likely exceed $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Before repairs start on bridges and roadways, contractors are encouraged to use safety resources and information available from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which provides guidelines for cleanup after torrential rains, flooding, and storm surges.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While working on roads and bridges, it is important to&amp;nbsp;use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; required for the worksite such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and hi-vis protective clothing to ensure workers&amp;#39; safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 3, 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) released three new documents aimed to educate workers and employers about how dangerous trenching operations can be and what hazards are typically associated with the methods.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Within the construction industry, unprotected trenches have proven to be the deadliest hazards. In the past eight years, more than 200 workers have lost their lives when trenches succumbed to cave-ins, with hundreds more suffering major injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cave&amp;ndash;ins during excavations are some of the most common and grisliest causes of worker fatalities in construction, yet they are entirely preventable,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;These new educational materials provide clear guidance on the necessary steps that employers must take to protect workers in trenches.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Trenching and Excavation Safety fact sheet provides an overview of possible hazards and the safety measures required to prevent them, and a new poster has been designed for placement at the work site. The poster depicts proper trenching techniques, and includes workers wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and hi-vis safety vests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;Working Safely in Trenches&amp;quot; quick card was also developed by the agency to be an easy to use reference guide about trenching hazards and safety measures with graphics. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;While the United States may not have nearly as many native poisonous creatures as other parts of the world, insect venom is still a very real threat in certain settings. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are at least three types of spider bites that can cause sores, irritation, pain, and in limited cases, even death in the U.S. Educate workers on the following CDC-recommended tips and provide them with the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; so that they are prepared for the possibility of spider bites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venomous species&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                According to the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, only about 60 of the 20,000 species of spiders in the Western Hemisphere are even physically capable of biting humans. Of those, only four produce poisonous venom. The following three are the only known spiders that have been associated with serious injury or illness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The black widow spider is the most common type of venomous spider found in the United States. They are concentrated mostly in the southern and western regions of the country and can be identified by a red pattern on their undersides. Black widows can be found in woodpiles, under eaves, in fences, and in piles of debris. They are also known to gather around outdoor toilets where there are many flies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As a web-spinning species, they often bite workers who have disturbed the strands that they have spun. Their bites are unique among spiders and insects in that they produce two tell-tale marks. Black widow venom is a neurotoxin that causes pain that begins at the bite area and can spread to the chest, abdomen, and then the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brown recluse or violin spiders are mostly found in the Midwest and South and can be identified by a dark violin-shaped mark on their heads. These spiders are often encountered underneath logs, on rocks, or in leaf piles. They will occasionally make their way indoors and are found in attics, basements, and other dark areas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brown recluse spiders require close contact and counter pressure to pierce the skin of humans, meaning that they will have to be trapped against the skin to puncture and release venom. Their bites begin with a white blister and if not treated can cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hobo spiders are almost entirely located in the Pacific Northwest. They are brown and have a distinctive yellow pattern on their abdomens. Instead of spinning a traditional web, these arachnids create funnel webs in holes, cracks, and recesses that they use to trap their prey. Workers should be especially wary of them near retaining walls, foundations, the cracks around window frames, and in piles of bricks and firewood.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A hobo spider cannot climb the way that other species can, but they run very quickly and will attack if provoked or threatened. Their bites can easily go unnoticed until a slow-healing wound develops and causes moderate to severe pain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                In addition to lesions, there are a number of tell-tale signs that an employee has been bitten, according to the CDC. Teach workers to be aware of these signs, especially if they have been working in high-risk environments.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; An itching or painful rash&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Muscle pain or cramps&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Red or purple discoloration and pain around the bite area&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Increased sweating and difficulty breathing&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Headache, nausea, and vomiting&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Fever, chills, and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educating staff members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Employers of workers who may be exposed to these venomous spiders should train employees to identify them. Show workers pictures of each venomous arachnid and guide them to exercise care when working around debris piles. Maintaining a clean and orderly outdoor worksite will reduce the risk that spiders will make their home nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Any clothes, shoes, or equipment that has been left outdoors should be checked and shaken out.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Outdoor clothing can go a long way toward keeping spiders from biting workers. Advise employees to wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, boots, and gloves whenever they spend time working outside. Any clothes or equipment that remains outdoors overnight should be wrapped tightly in plastic bags and completely sealed to keep spiders out.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Provide workers with the opportunity to receive inoculations against tetanus. Spider bites can become infected with tetanus spores.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps to take when workers are bitten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Train workers to handle spider bite scenarios so that they know how to react when a black widow, brown recluse, hobo spider, or other arachnid bites an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is important to remain calm. If properly educated, employees should attempt to identify the type of spider that bit them. This will help medical professionals later if they decide to administer an anti-venom.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wounds should be washed with soap and water to prevent infection, but never attempt to remove the venom in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A cold compress or ice pack will help to soothe the area and reduce swelling. The bite area should also be elevated if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A supervisor should be notified immediately and workers should contact medical professionals as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking care when working outside&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                The majority of spiders will likely attack because their habitats have been disturbed. Employees should exercise great care outdoors and realize that they are working in the natural homes of many creatures. Consequently, staying alert in the woods and keeping work areas clean of debris will help employees avoid harm.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers should provide &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies"&gt;first aid kits&lt;/a&gt; and personal protective equipment such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; to give added protection. Training focused on bite scenarios and proper education of a workforce will help to minimize the dangers that spiders and other arachnids pose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The recent Warner Bros. Pictures film Contagion depicts a scenario in which the world struggles to stop a global outbreak of a deadly respiratory virus. In the movie, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) fights to contain the deadly outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, the CDC Foundation has announced that while the theatrics of the movie may be far fetched, the possibility of a global outbreak of a serious, deadly disease is very real. On average, one contagion is investigated each year by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But it is not only new diseases that can spread with deadly results. Some illnesses that have long been thought to be controlled in the U.S., such as tuberculosis, could once again appear more deadly than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If an outbreak were to occur, the CDC&amp;#39;s Emergency Operations Center would serve as the command center for monitoring the threat level of the virus. The center is staffed 24/7 and is open for contact for reporting public health threats including the flu, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Safety precautions in the workplace include regularly washing hands and wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as health masks or gloves, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Missouri Department of Labor recently released its annual statistics on workplace fatalities. The preliminary data showed that a total of 107 fatal workplace injuries were reported in the state in 2010, marking a 25 percent drop from the 142 deaths recorded in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Department has been working hard to promote the free workplace safety programs we offer to employers that save lives. Since this administration came into office, participation in the state&amp;rsquo;s elite safety program has increased by 56 percent,&amp;quot; says Department Director Larry Rebman. &amp;quot;This drop in fatalities shows that workplaces are embracing safety and doing more to protect workers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average for workplace fatalities remained relatively the same, highlighting Missouri&amp;#39;s commitment to improving safety at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most workplace deaths were seen in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sector, with 25 fatalities in 2010. 23 of these 25 fatalities took place during crop production. For the second year in a row, transportation incidents which include highway, non-highway, air, water, rail fatalities, and being struck by a vehicle were the leading fatality causing events in 2010, accounting for 60 of the 107 total fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By maintaining safe practices at the workplace and utilizing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, employers across the nation can work to create a safe environment for employees, as demonstrated in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Several of the leading researchers in occupational injury are expected to convene in Morgantown, West Virginia&amp;#39;s Waterfront Place Hotel on October 18, 19, and 20 for the 2011 National Occupational Injury Research Symposium (NOIRS).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The event, which is now in its fifth year, will give researchers the opportunity to present their latest findings and suggest methods to remedy those results. NOIRS will be hosted in partnership with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (LMRIS) and the National Safety Council (NSC).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The cooperating partners will provide a forum for researchers to discuss traumatic occupational injuries with other experts.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The symposium is expected to include oral presentations supplemented with poster presentations and slideshows, which will describe current methods of research as well as studies and findings related to occupational injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the last five years, NOIRS has become a highly-anticipated annual event that focuses on discussing work-related traumatic injuries and ways to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Topics to be discussed will include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems. Safety guidelines will be discussed across various work sites, including construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and machine safety. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that October 9 through October 15 was National Fire Prevention Week, with the 2011 theme of &amp;quot;Protect your Family from Fire.&amp;quot; The campaign was developed to keep individuals, their families, and their communities safe from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and FEMA are providing fire prevention tips and resources going forward, including information materials and tips on the leading causes of fires.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Annual observances like National Fire Prevention Week are excellent opportunities to focus on fire hazards - but we should all practice fire safety every day - at work, at play, and particularly at home,&amp;rdquo; said FEMA Regional Administrator Ken Murphy. &amp;quot;The most common causes of home fires include cooking, heating, electrical malfunction, smoking materials, and candles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;FEMA states that several small steps can be taken to prevent damaging fires, including staying in the kitchen while cooking, having chimneys inspected regularly, and keeping flammable materials away from light bulbs and lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Also, using flashlights in the event of a power outage, rather than candles, significantly lowers the chance of fire.&amp;nbsp;If a candle is used indoors, keep them away from anything that can easily burn, and make sure to blow them out before going into another room.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), it is important for homes and businesses to have fire &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, which includes large and portable fire extinguishers, readily available. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced it will host an informal meeting at which stakeholders will discuss ways to prevent occupational hearing loss. The public meeting is being held to determine the best practices for hearing conservation programs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Additional topics will include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and engineering controls used to prevent hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Between 20,000 and 25,000 workers suffer preventable hearing loss every year due to high workplace noise levels,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;In January, OSHA committed to holding this stakeholder meeting to elicit the views of employers, workers, noise control experts and public health professionals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The meeting is set to take place in Washington, D.C., on November 3, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, several safety measures can be utilized to prevent worker hearing loss, including opting for low-noise machinery, keeping equipment well-maintained and lubricated, placing sound walls or curtains between machinery and workers, and isolating the noise source.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; or ear muffs, is required by OSHA in high noise level workplaces to protect workers&amp;#39; hearing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A recent article in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;#39;s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) noted that occupational epidemiology by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has helped to make the workplace safer and healthier for more than 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The article notes that The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 created three roles for epidemiology to be part of NIOSH&amp;#39;s expertise. These roles have helped fuel advances in protecting against a wide range of workplace hazards. The roles that were developed and are still in use today include field epidemiology under the Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) program, epidemiology in large studies across multiple sites, and surveillance for work-related illnesses and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC states that NIOSH has successfully improved the ways to measure, identify, and address hazards such as traumatic injuries among firefighters, the risk of infection from sharps injuries for healthcare workers, fatal injuries among teen workers, and pesticide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC wants NIOSH to continue to work with occupational diseases and injuries into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The ultimate challenge for NIOSH is to not only effectively control occupational diseases and injuries that are the remnants of the last century, but also to preempt new hazardous exposures and conditions from gaining a foothold in the new century,&amp;quot; wrote Dr. Halperin and Dr. Howard, the article&amp;#39;s authors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Along with NIOSH&amp;#39;s accomplishments in workplace safety, advancements in &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as&amp;nbsp;respirators and protective coveralls, have also contributed to safer U.S. workplaces. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and The Fire Protection Research Foundation (FPRF) have announced they will be hosting the Alternative Energy Technologies and Electrical Safety Standards Symposium in Atlanta on December 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The symposium will address new questions of safety and reliability that have come about as more businesses are beginning to use alternative energy sources and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The landscape for electric and alternative technologies is rapidly changing,&amp;quot; said Kathleen Almand, executive director of the Foundation. &amp;quot;New technology brings new safety issues to consider, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to continue to learn and develop appropriate safety procedures. The Symposium will provide an opportunity for attendees to get familiar with these technologies and get a glimpse of what lies ahead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The forum will allow professionals in electric and alternative energy and safety industry leaders to discuss aspects of safety and how they relate to the National Electric Code.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Included at the symposium will be information on new lighting technologies, photovoltaic systems, emerging technologies, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Engineers and other power supply workers can greatly reduce the risk of injury by wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as non-conductive&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and should continue to do so as the energy sector continues to change. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In use for thousands of years, asbestos was first discovered in ancient times and hailed as a miracle substance. Its name is Greek in origin and means &amp;quot;inextinguishable&amp;quot; because it refused to burn and was exceptionally resistant to fire. In fact, until very recently, it was still a popular material because of its strength, flame resistance, and insulation properties.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, scientists have since discovered that asbestos poses significant health risks to people who live near it and those who work around it. It is actually a mineral composed of microscopic fibers, which can be spread through the air and enter the lungs, causing lung scarring (asbestosis), inflammation of the chest cavity (pleuritis), and cancers. As a result, employers must be very careful at worksites that may have asbestos or when they task personnel with cleaning it up.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Prior to a few decades ago, asbestos was commonly used for insulating pipes, on wall panels, in floor tiles, in spray ceiling coatings, and as packing material. Asbestos in all of these forms poses a threat, but it&amp;#39;s most dangerous to people who tear it down.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines dictate that companies must adhere to a strict permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 fibers of asbestos per cubic centimeter of air in a given enclosed space over the course of eight hours. It is also required by OSHA to provide workers with the proper breathing protection. Depending on the level of exposure, employers must provide workers with half-mask or full-facepiece air purifying respirators equipped with high efficiency filters. For greater exposure, full-facepiece supplied air respirators or a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Companies must also perform initial and periodic exposure assessments which monitor the level of asbestos in a given area when work begins and routinely throughout its removal. It is also important to regulate and limit access to areas where this work is taking place because of the danger that asbestos presents. This can be accomplished with signs marking restricted or off-limit areas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Because asbestos is made of tiny particles, it should never be swept or wiped with dry rags that can release more particulates into the air. Instead, asbestos should be cleaned using wet methods or wetting agents that reduce its ability to break apart and contaminate the air. Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters need to be used to collect all asbestos-containing or presumed asbestos-containing debris and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Never attempt to clean up or handle asbestos without accreditation from the EPA or other regulatory agency. The Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986 requires large-scale efforts to remove asbestos be undertaken only by those who have been trained to handle it. With the right education and training, as well as the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;, companies can efficiently remove this dangerous substance from their worksites. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 5, 2011, David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), spoke before the Congressional Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Michaels took the opportunity to detail the important work OSHA is doing to protect American workers and to hear comments and suggestions on how the agency could best fulfill its mission to create a safe workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In his statement, Michaels urged members of Congress not to become so enveloped in the current economic crisis that they put workplace safety on the backburner, citing President Obama&amp;#39;s address to the Joint Session of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What we can&amp;#39;t do,&amp;quot; Obama said, &amp;quot;is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Michaels highlighted the many successes of OSHA, especially in developing standards for &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Currently, 25 states have adopted OSHA-approved State Plans that help to develop workplace safety measures including fall protection strategies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety Equipment&lt;/span&gt; Association (ISEA) has released two new documents that aim to help workers and employers prevent injuries due to falls from heights.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Personal &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Fall Protection&lt;/span&gt; Equipment Use and Selection Guide&amp;quot; offers help in choosing an appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; system, and also provides administrators with maintenance and inspection guidelines. The document is supplemented by a second guide that discusses the most frequently asked questions regarding fall protection systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some of the questions about equipment addressed in the second guide &amp;quot;Frequently Addressed Topics in Fall Protection&amp;quot; include harness attachments, horizontal lifelines, how to position a self- retracting lifeline, the location and strength of anchorage, tie-back applications, and twin-leg lanyards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Falls are a leading cause of death and injuries in the workplace, and they&amp;rsquo;re preventable,&amp;quot; said Bob Apel, chairman of the Fall Protection Group (FPG). &amp;quot;At many work sites, fall hazards can&amp;rsquo;t be eliminated, and ISEA members make the best equipment and systems in the world to prevent and stop falls. This guide will help employers and users understand how to select the right equipment and use it properly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there were 635 workplace fatalities caused by falls from heights in 2010. Improvements in &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" target="_blank"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; and better implementation of equipment has led to a 25 percent decrease in fatal falls since 2007. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 11, 2011, Joe Szabo of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a new advisory to the railroad industry in order to prevent injuries related to switching operations between railcars and other dangerous workplace behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Szabo stated that the industry must strive for &amp;quot;meticulous safety compliance,&amp;quot; and workers should put workplace safety above the speed of train movement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safety is our number one priority, and we are committed to protecting the welfare of our rail workers,&amp;quot; U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a recent release. &amp;quot;This advisory stresses the importance of taking necessary precautions and putting safety first.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                In recent months, three railroad industry workers have lost their lives after being caught between rolling equipment. The FRA is issuing the Safety Advisory to heighten compliance with established safety rules in place to protect employees who have to work between rolling equipment..&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The advisory notes that although railroad safety has significantly improved over the years, the fatal events that have taken place in recent months indicate more work should be done to improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When working in rail yards, employees need to follow all established safety guidelines, be aware of their surroundings at all times, and always wear appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, to protect from hazards that may be present in the workplace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 13, 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published new educational resources that will aid laboratory managers in keeping their workers safe from a number of hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Included in the materials is the Laboratory Safety Guidance, which details how electrical, fire, explosion, and fall hazards can be kept to a minimum if employers follow safety plans, make a commitment to worker training, install engineering controls, and enforce the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These educational materials will help employers identify hazards and measures to ensure safe and healthy conditions for their workers and promote a robust safety culture in the workplace,&amp;quot; Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA David Michaels stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the past several years, numerous laboratory incidents have led to fatalities and injuries from fires, explosions and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In OSHA&amp;#39;s Laboratory Safety Guidance document, a PPE standard is established. This standard requires that employers provide and ensure that workers are using&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that protect the eyes and face, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and shields, as well as hand protection, which includes &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; that protect against skin absorption of harmful substances.&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;When companies deal with health and safety issues, they often consider the cost of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; and equipment. Medical expenses and traditional health benefits often appear to be the most essential financial needs for safety departments and EHS professionals. Curiously enough, many employers overlook one of the simplest solutions of all - employee wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wellness refers to general strategies to make employees healthier. It offers a number of benefits, including reducing the cost of health insurance, reducing the severity of workplace injuries, and giving workers more energy and flexibility to do their jobs. In addition to personal protective equipment and comprehensive medical coverage, wellness can go a long way toward making workers safer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial advantages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                It can be difficult to add up the savings that a wellness program will provide, but the Vermont Department of Health estimates that a workforce in poor health can indirectly cost a company two to three times what the direct medical costs would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The level of effort that workers put into their jobs can also be greatly affected by wellness. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Preventing Chronic Disease published a study of an Austin, Texas, company that started a wellness program in 2009. Besides increases in general health and fitness, the program was responsible for significant reductions in expenses caused by employee healthcare and absenteeism.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Absenteeism is when employees don&amp;#39;t come to work for various health-related reasons. Seasonal illness, workplace injuries, and other causes of ill health are at the heart of absenteeism. Another important pitfall that workplaces must avoid is presenteeism, which is when staff members come to work when they&amp;#39;re sick and transmit their illnesses to co-workers, leading to even greater absenteeism, reduced productivity, and higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of wellness programs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Quite a few of these programs are meant to reduce obesity and reduce the risk of heart disease among personnel. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. Some organizations choose to include gym memberships and nutritionist consultations in employee benefits packages and encourage workers to use them. Others hold exercise clinics and sessions after work, either on company property or offsite.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Wellness programs can also be used to address another severe risk to employee health - tobacco use. Many workers who smoke have elevated risks for heart disease and high blood pressure. One way to address this issue is to ban smoking on premises. Companies could also choose to offer literature explaining the benefits of quitting or even provide medical discounts to workers who quit.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and healthy workplaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Wellness programs can be a good way for companies to provide additional compensation to their workers and can significantly reduce costs that are associated with medical insurance, absenteeism, and disability. Healthy work environments will also be much more productive and will promote a strong ethic of fitness and safety to all workers.&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Terrorist events on U.S. soil and ongoing threats emphasize the importance of emergency preparedness in the workplace. Certain companies and worksites are more susceptible to violence from extremists than others and should take the necessary measures to keep themselves and their employees safe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What terrorism usually looks like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Department of Labor (DOL), most potential terrorist attacks would come in the form of arson or through the use of explosive devices. Although other types of attacks are less likely, OSHA continues to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and, within CDC, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to help increase workplace safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most important step that any company can take to prepare for an arson or explosive device attack is to constantly review and update its fire emergency protocols. A fire escape plan that includes frequent drills is first and foremost. An escape route should be cleared of obstructions, clearly marked, and familiar to workers due to regular practice and review.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is also important to make sure that the right fire emergency &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is visible to employees and located in many places throughout a factory, warehouse, or office building.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerable workplaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                While it&amp;#39;s true that a terrorist attack could happen anywhere, OSHA warns that there are some workplaces that are more vulnerable to extremist attacks than others. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Those that provide essential services, such as subways, sewage treatment plants, electric facilities, fuel depots, and telephone headquarters&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Places with a high volume of pedestrian traffic&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Areas that have limited emergency exits, such as high-rise complexes or underground facilities&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Those that have a high volume of incoming materials, such as postal centers, import and export terminals, and raw material processing plants&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; High-profile targets like dams, military installations, and classified sites&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Transportation systems such as shipyards, bus terminals, train stations, and airline facilities&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These workplaces are advised to create terrorist attack preparedness plans. OSHA does not provide specific guidelines for this sort of preparation, but such companies are advised to consult with local authorities, the FBI, ATF, and their Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). These organizations will evaluate the risk of terrorist violence and help with the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                OSHA&amp;#39;s contribution to extremist violence preparedness comes in the form of its risk levels or zones, which describe how organizations should evaluate and prepare for possible hazards that they may face from terrorist attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; &amp;quot;Green Zone&amp;quot; is used to describe most businesses. These facilities have limited vulnerability, are not as directly threatened, and have little potential to cause a significant impact if attacked&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; &amp;quot;Yellow Zone&amp;quot; includes companies that have one of the following: a high level of vulnerability to attack, a high threat level, or the potential to create a significantly catastrophic event if struck by terrorists&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; &amp;quot;Red Zone&amp;quot; will have two or more of a high level of vulnerability, a high threat level, and a high chance of catastrophic impact if attacked&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that companies that do not fit a particular Zone&amp;#39;s criteria but are in close proximity to facilities that exist in a Zone above their own should treat themselves as members of that higher zone.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection and security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Companies that are concerned about terrorist attacks should examine the potential threat to their businesses and the possible devices that could be involved in an attack. Once a determination has been made, it&amp;#39;s important for employers to contact local and federal authorities if they feel that their workplaces are at significant risk for a terrorist attack, create and review evacuation plans, and provide adequate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; for their workers in case of an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 12, 2011, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Buildings Commissioner Robert LiMandri announced that the NYC Development Hub, a new center that seeks to expedite the approval process for new construction projects, is open and ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The facility allows architects and engineers to present project ideas through smart boards, large television screens, computer tablets, and webcams, allowing examiners to review thousands of new designs faster and more efficiently. However safety, city officials insist, will not be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When New York&amp;rsquo;s businesses and developers decide to invest in the city&amp;rsquo;s future, the city should it make it easy as possible for them to comply with critical safety and regulatory protections,&amp;quot; said Robert K. Steel, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. &amp;quot;By using technology to break down barriers and improve our internal processes, the Development Hub will create jobs and accelerate New York City&amp;rsquo;s economic growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fire commissioner Salvatore Cassano added that the new hub was a &amp;quot;win-win,&amp;quot; in that it provided faster customer service but upheld the city&amp;#39;s high public safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees working at any construction or development sites are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to use appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, to minimize the risk of injury. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 13, 2011, the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) recognized members from its Bureau of Fire Prevention for their efforts in keeping New York residents safe from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The work you do is meticulous,&amp;quot; Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano told members during the ceremony at FDNY Headquarters. &amp;quot;It involves long hours and lots of hard work, but it saves lives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In all, 19 members were honored as Inspectors of the Year, while one worker was recognized for Clerical Support. At the ceremony, the 34 new members who joined the bureau in the last year were also recognized for their roles in such an important agency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Each year Fire Prevention shows they are a stronger, better team than ever before,&amp;quot; Chief of Department Edward Kilduff said. &amp;quot;Your expertise is something that&amp;#39;s never questioned.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The bureau helps ensure the city&amp;#39;s safety by providing resources and information on &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, that can help save lives. According to the bureau, fire safety plans should be adopted by workplaces, hotels/motels and other places of assembly, and sprinkler system tests should be performed regularly. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2011, The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced that workplace injuries and illnesses that occur in the private industry fell in 2010 to a rate of 3.5 cases per 100 full time workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report marks a decline from the rate of 3.6 in 2009. The total number of workplace injuries and illnesses in 2010 was just below 3.1 million recordable cases, down from 3.3 million cases in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are encouraged by the reported decline in incidence rates for workplace injuries and illnesses, which is reflective of the joint effort of government, business, unions, and other organizations,&amp;quot; Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis stated. &amp;quot;Nevertheless, 3.1 million injuries and illnesses in the workplace is too high. Workers should not have to sacrifice their health and safety to earn a paycheck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Solis added that the country still has a long way to go in creating more secure manufacturing workplaces, which reported the highest injury and illness rates at 4.4 cases for every 100 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers can help lower the number of workplace injuries and illnesses that occur every year by ensuring their employees are using appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;With the Federal Communications Commission&amp;#39;s (FCC&amp;#39;s) Emergency Alert System (EAS) Nationwide Test approaching, awareness of the test is growing across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The test, which will be the first time the EAS is tested nationwide, will take place at 2 p.m. EST on November 9, 2011. Officials expect it to assess how reliable and effective the system is at alerting the public of a national emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Currently, EAS participants only conduct monthly statewide tests and weekly local tests, but no review of how well the system could work on a national level has been conducted. The results of the upcoming test will allow the FCC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make necessary changes to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Several media outlets across the country have heightened their efforts to inform the public that the test will take place next month. On October 24, for instance, The Hillsboro Reporter in Texas detailed the alert and relayed the information offered by the FCC in order to keep local residents informed about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the event of a nationwide emergency, disaster preparedness is essential. This includes a readily available &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;, fire &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In 2010, the prevalence of four infections commonly seen in healthcare facilities declined, but more work is needed to eliminate healthcare-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At a policy summit held on October 19, 2011, in Washington, D.C., staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided details on how the reduction is occurring in heathcare facilities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hospitals continue to make impressive progress in driving down certain infections in intensive care units through implementation of CDC prevention strategies,&amp;quot; said CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden. &amp;quot;Hospitals and state health departments need to translate this progress to other areas of healthcare delivery and healthcare infections.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC reported that in 2010, there was a 33 percent drop in central line-associated bloodstream infections, with a 35 percent reduction in critical care patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the summit, officials also discussed how to boost patient safety and quality improvement. Denise Cardo, M.D., Director of CDC&amp;rsquo;s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion stated, &amp;ldquo;Preventing infections in healthcare saves lives and reduces healthcare costs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Healthcare workers can prevent the spread of infections by wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as masks, shields, and gloves, when working with infectious patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many former factories and waste disposal facilities have fallen into disrepair and may be abandoned, leaving behind pollutants or contaminants. Fortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sponsors cleanups of these areas, making them attractive sites for companies to engage in urban renewal and rehabilitation. In fact, the EPA estimates that every dollar the organization spends on such efforts yields $18.29 in corporate and private profits. Additionally, it is projected that over 72,000 jobs have been generated so far thanks to brownfield cleanups.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brownfields pose unique hazards to workers and may make it necessary for employers to take additional steps to ensure their workers are safe and protected when engaging in brownfield cleanups and during land reclamation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common dangers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Waste and pollutants found in soil, buildings, containers, and groundwater aquifers can create some of the biggest hazards that can be found at brownfield sites. Before environmental regulations were commonplace, many organizations disposed of chemicals on-site without adequate protective measures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers should be trained to handle materials that might be found during excavations. Chemical hazards from contaminants could be present in the soil or containers on the worksite, so employees need to wear coveralls and disposable respirators when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many brownfield sites are often in various states of disrepair because they have been deemed too dangerous or polluted for everyday work. When working on a facility for re-use or redevelopment, there may be crumbling walls and collapsed foundations that require personnel to build scaffolding or use aerial lifts to reach high places. Outfit these workers with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; such as web lanyards and fall harnesses to ensure their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Collapses and falling debris, as well as cave-ins and crumbling trenches, put employees at risk. Use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and steel-toed boots to prevent injury.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Review the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard. This standard applies to brownfield sites that include work such as:&lt;br /&gt;
                1. Cleanup operations required by a governmental body involving hazardous substances conducted at an uncontrolled hazardous waste site.&lt;br /&gt;
                2. Corrective actions involving cleanup operations at sites covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.&lt;br /&gt;
                3. Voluntary cleanup operations at sites recognized by a governmental body as an uncontrolled hazardous waste site.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If the HAZWOPER standard applies, OSHA regulations require employers who are engaged in repairs or cleanup efforts at formerly polluted sites to create a written Health and Safety Plan (HASP) before beginning work. This sort of plan must be specific to each new worksite, though it may be possible to draw upon parts of former strategies as long as the necessary details of each site have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The components of a HASP may include a site hazard analysis, control measures for leaking materials, an evaluation of necessary personal protective equipment, employee training for chemical handling, medical surveillance measures, decontamination procedures, monitoring and sampling, spill containment, confined space requirements, and emergency response strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A HASP can be developed with help from a number of agencies. The Department of Labor (DOL) offers cleanup training for various hazardous materials and helps coordinate Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs in brownfield communities. The DOL maintains regional offices around the country and can help employers prepare the necessary training measures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Additionally, OSHA-approved local environmental agencies operating at the state level can help with on-site consultations to determine which materials pose a risk to workers and how to properly dispose of the materials.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                With the added emphasis on ecologically friendly work practices and green initiatives, companies around the country are discovering that it is both profitable and helpful for communities to rehabilitate urban areas and former worksites. With the right training from government agencies and the proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, employers can effectively help to clean up ecologically damaged sites while keeping their workers safe.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;At the Congress and Expo 2011, the National Safety Council (NSC) recognized 40 professionals under the age of 40 for their work in making worksites safer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Rising Stars of Safety&amp;quot; program was developed by the NSC to encourage tomorrow&amp;#39;s leaders to commit to safety programs and share their knowledge, insight, and experiences in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To have a strong safety culture, safety needs to be acknowledged as everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility within an organization,&amp;quot; Janet Froetcher, president and CEO of NSC, stated. &amp;quot;We are pleased not only to be recognizing safety professionals; this year&amp;rsquo;s class also includes a digital media coordinator, a human resources director, a regional director of customer operations, and several vice presidents of organizations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Froetcher added that it will be essential to understand the needs of the next generation of workplace safety leaders in order for the NSC to further its mission of safety. With the help of the up-and-coming industry leaders, Froetcher says, the Council will be able to prevent more injuries and save more lives.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the NSC, many eye, head, and foot injuries can be lessened or avoided altogether with the proper personal protective equipment (PPE).&amp;nbsp;Keep your employees protected by creating a safety program for your workplace that includes requirements for the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Workplaces often use aerial lifts when staging and scaffolding are impractical. This aids many jobs that might not otherwise be possible, but there are a number of dangers associated with their use. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), electricians, general laborers, painters, ironworkers, and carpenters are especially at risk for injuries and fatalities when using these machines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) report that most falls, collapses, and tipovers that occur on aerial lifts happened while between 10 and 29 feet in the air. Machinery tipovers made up nearly 50 percent of the total boom-lift falls. When your crews are working on aerial lifts, take the following precautions to keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Aerial lifts are strong machines that must be carefully maneuvered to the work site before using the controls to move the platform. These lifts need to be serviced and maintained regularly and should only be operated by employees who have been trained thoroughly to use them. Supervisors should also always be present when the lift is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Riders and workers at the top of aerial lifts should always use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;. When shipyards and boatyards use lifts, working above water is no excuse not to - according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), life preservers and other floatation devices are insufficient when used alone in protecting workers from falls of over 40 feet. Shock-absorbing lanyards, harnesses, and retractable lanyards should always be used and securely anchored to lift railings or hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The wheels of a lift should never be operated or moved while its arm is raised or a worker is on it. Shifts in balance can easily cause a fall or can eject employees from the bucket or platform of the lift. In fact, no lift should ever be raised if the brakes aren&amp;#39;t engaged, its outriggers are not fully extended, tire pressure is low, or the ground that the lift sits on is not level.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Lift operators need to be aware of the lift&amp;#39;s swing radius. This means that a rotation of 360 degrees will extend the basket or cherry picker a specific distance from the base. Workers operating lifts should always make sure that the area around the machine is clear of other equipment and employees before moving the lift arm.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When a crane is not available, an aerial lift is not a suitable replacement. It is not designed to push, pull, or manipulate objects and other devices and can malfunction if used to do so. This sort of situation can cause a tipover, which will endanger nearby workers as well as the operator of the lift.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If for some reason an aerial lift becomes caught on a tree, structure, or wire, the operator should not struggle to release it. When freed suddenly, the basket of a lift can eject employees or knock them off balance.&lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                By understanding that there are many dangers associated with this equipment, employees can avoid being injured on an aerial lift. With the right &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;, such as fall protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, workplaces can successfully and safely use aerial lifts for many tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On October 25, 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced that Erich J. (Pete) Stafford will be the new chair of the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH), replacing longstanding chairman Frank L. Migliaccio, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pete&amp;#39;s wealth of knowledge and experience on a wide range of construction health and safety matters makes him an ideal choice to chair this important committee,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;We appreciate his commitment to protect the welfare of our nation&amp;#39;s construction workers and look forward to his leadership.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new chairman has a wealth of experience in occupational safety and health, especially within the construction industry. Currently, Stafford works as executive director of the Center for Construction Research and Training (CCRT), a facility that conducts research and organizes training operations for more than 100,000 construction workers each year. The center produces detailed construction health and safety research reports each year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), improvements in construction industry safety have led to a 40 percent decrease in workplace fatalities since 2006. In addition, fatal falls on construction sites have dropped 25 percent since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proper selection, training, and use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems can reduce injuries. Using site-specific fall protection plans will help identify hazards and provide solutions that can be implemented for worker safety.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the American Public Health Association (APHA) indicates that despite improved safety measures, U.S. construction workers still have a high risk of workplace injuries and an increased risk of occupational illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined data from a number of national sources and concluded that the average American construction worker has a 75 percent chance of suffering a debilitating injury across a 45-year career. Data also indicate that one out of every 200 workers is at risk for being fatally injured at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While great strides have been made in reducing construction injuries and illnesses, the numbers are still stubbornly high,&amp;quot; Pete Stafford, executive director of Center for Construction and Research Training (CPWR), said in an APHA news release.&amp;quot;Workers and their families suffer the consequences of disabling injuries, and this research shows it&amp;#39;s far too common.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), several dangerous factors affect the health of construction workers, including working at height, noise, dust, confined spaces, electricity, and the use of power tools and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers who wear appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, dust masks or respirators, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, can greatly reduce the risk of injury or work-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has announced it will hold a two-day Buy Quiet Workshop, November 9-10, 2011, to encourage greater use of engineering noise controls at construction sites and in manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The event is a National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) activity, and will be jointly organized by its Construction Sector and Manufacturing Sector Programs, as well as the NIOSH Hearing Loss Prevention Cross-sector program.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The workshop is intended to determine feasibility and functionality of Buy Quiet programs and discuss steps that will ensure its successful implementation. In the end, workshop officials hope to encourage a wider adoption of noise control techniques in the construction and manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 30 million people are exposed to hazardous noise in the workplace each year. Hearing loss due to occupational noise has been one of the most prevalent work hazards for more than 25 years, indicating a need for better protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and ear muffs, and enclosing or isolating the noise source with sound barriers, have been proven to significantly reduce dangerous noise levels. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New and revised information on worker and employers&amp;#39; rights has recently been published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The information details how to protect workers from hazards in the construction, maritime, and general industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s Small Entity Compliance Guide for Respiratory Protection Standard provides a detailed guide for small businesses to follow, and offers checklists and frequently asked questions that benefit employers and workers by better understanding the Administration&amp;#39;s respiratory protection standard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The guide explains the benefits and uses of various respiratory protection systems, including gas and dust masks, and respirators.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Revised documents include new information on aerial lifts and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, advice for safe trenching and the necessary &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; associated with the activity, nail gun safety, and protecting workers from heat stress. Also revised is OSHA&amp;#39;s Worker&amp;#39;s Rights booklet, which details the rights that all workers have under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The information discusses several topics, including rights, how to file a complaint, protection for whistleblowers, and resources for education and training.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By setting and enforcing safety standards, and providing training, education, and assistance, OSHA works to keep the American workplace a safe and comfortable environment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It has been 40 years since the U.S. Congress and President Richard Nixon made a series of radical proposals to ensure that all workers are provided with a safe working environment, and that injuries, illnesses, and fatalities are avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, four decades later, the hard work of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has led to a dramatic difference in workplace safety. Since 1970, workplace fatalities have dropped by more than 65 percent and occupational injury and illness rates have declined by 67 percent, all while the American workforce nearly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In a speech at the Center for American Progress, Assistant Secretary of Labor Dr. Davis Michaels noted that before OSHA, workplace injuries, illnesses and death were seen merely as an unfortunate result.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is hard to believe... before OSHA, workers in America did not have the basic human right to a safe workplace,&amp;quot; he stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 1970, there were 38 worker deaths per day on average. By 2010, that number had dropped significantly to 12 worker deaths. Worker injury and illnesses are down from 10.9 incidents per 100 workers in 1972 to 4 per 100 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With the advent of advanced &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, employees can work with confidence that their safety is not in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) has published updates to its American National Standard for High-Visibility Public Safety Vests, ANSI/ISEA207-2011, which outlines the design, performance specifications, and utilization of safety vests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The revision includes updates to the initial publication from 2006, and was approved by major stakeholders from fire and police forces, testing laboratories, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" target="_blank"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; manufacturers, and government organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ISEA members are aware of the need for emergency personnel to be recognized during a situation where multiple responders may be present and where their identification is critical to mitigating the crisis at hand,&amp;quot; noted Jim Teigen, chairman of the ISEA High-Visibility Products Group. &amp;quot;The standard serves to meet the desires of the wearers through identification means on the vest, while ensuring that they are visible to vehicle operators at the same time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The update also highlights the service-life guidelines for high-visibility apparel that have been established by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is important that wearers understand that a public safety vest&amp;rsquo;s ongoing visibility properties can be influenced by environmental and use conditions,&amp;quot; stated Teigen. &amp;quot;For these reasons, they should become familiar with FHWA and manufacturers&amp;rsquo; guidelines to ensure that they are wearing items that provide the necessary protection from a visibility standpoint.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 1, 2011, the National Safety Council (NSC) and the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH) renewed their partnership during a ceremony at the NSC Congress and Expo in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The renewed agreement was signed by Dr. John Howard, director of NIOSH, and Janet Froetscher, NSC president and CEO to continue to improve the safety of workplaces across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We value the partnership of the National Safety Council in working together to identify and seize opportunities to prevent work-related injuries,&amp;quot; Dr. John Howard, director of NIOSH, said. &amp;quot;Occupational safety is a vital strategy that benefits workers, their families and communities, and businesses alike.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The two agencies stated they will work together to enhance research, communication, and development opportunities for safety and health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Using the collaborative efforts and expertise each of our organizations can provide will help to better advance the protection of workers, promote best practices, and encourage more employers to develop and use safety management systems,&amp;quot; said Janet Froetscher, NSC president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported 212,760 fall injuries in 2009. By extending the partnership, the two organizations will continue work to increase proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Using N-Specs&amp;reg; Tri-Star&amp;reg; OTG Over-The-Glass &lt;span class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety Glasses&lt;/span&gt; with Clear Lens is a simple and economical way to protect workers&amp;#39; eyes. According to the Vision Council of America&amp;#39;s Visionwatch study, 63.5 percent of adults were wearing eyeglasses in 2010. OSHA requires employers to ensure that employees who wear prescription lenses use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that incorporates the prescription or use eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 10, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) held a free webinar designed to inform all contractors, landlords, property managers, and anyone performing work on residential renovation, repair, and painting projects on lead-safe work practices required under agency rules.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The informational seminar was held to raise awareness of the Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (RRP), which outlines required work practices for dealing with dried lead-based paints usually found in older buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anyone receiving compensation for renovating, repairing and painting work in residences built before 1978 that disturbs painted surfaces is required to receive training and certification from an EPA-accredited training provider for lead safe work practices,&amp;quot; the agency said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The session discussed who must follow RRP requirements, how companies can best comply with the rules, and how to become a certified lead-safe firm.&amp;nbsp;The EPA offers ongoing information on how to find or become lead-safe certified through the EPA&amp;#39;s National Lead Information Center.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are several specific standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)&amp;nbsp;concerning lead in the construction industry, including safety training standards and the use of personal protective and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as respiratory protection and protective clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2011, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that $2 million in emergency funds will be immediately available for the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to further repair bridges and roads affected by Tropical Storm Lee flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Obama Administration stands ready to provide emergency relief to New York as it recovers from the damages caused by Tropical Storm Lee,&amp;quot; LaHood said. &amp;quot;We are making funds available right away to restore roads and bridges.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The storm, which ravaged several areas already inundated by waters from Hurricane Irene just two weeks earlier, also severely damaged transportation infrastructure across northeastern and upstate New York. NYSDOT says the funds will be used to quickly reopen critical traffic arteries by repairing washed out bridges and roadways and clearing lingering debris from roadways.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) guidelines for keeping workers safe during cleanup and recovery after major storms provide information on several topics, including electrical safety, decontamination, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, personal &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and portable ladder safety.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 8, 2011, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published five new safety recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard regarding the commercial fishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The commercial fishing industry continues to have the highest fatality rate of all occupations in the United States; the safety hazards of this industry are unacceptable,&amp;quot; said NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman. &amp;quot;While numerous laws have been passed to protect fishing grounds and fish populations, regulations to improve the safety of commercial fisherman are long overdue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The NTSB has been concerned with the fishing industry for years, finding that between 1992 and 2008, 158 of every 100,000 commercial fishing industry workers were killed, compared to 4 deaths per 100,000 workers in all occupations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Key issues the tougher standards address include improved &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/protective-clothing/protective-flotation-vests-suits-ring-buoy/flotation"&gt;flotation devices&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;more crew training, and strategies for keeping accidents and injuries to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that commercial fishing has consistently ranked among the deadliest occupations since 1992, the first year in which the agency began publishing death rates by occupation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;From November 30 to December 2, 2011, federal and Arlington, Virginia-area officials will meet to discuss how the terrorist attacks of 9/11 have changed the way the country looks at disaster risk and preparedness, and how it has affected the security and safety equipment markets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;9/11 +10&amp;quot; forum will be a part of the International Safety Equipment Association&amp;#39;s (ISEA&amp;#39;s) Fall Meeting, which is the organization&amp;#39;s largest national gathering. The meeting is held annually for product groups and committees to develop standards, formulate legislative positions, and examine the current market trends to better understand which &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is needed in the appropriate locations and workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On the first day of the event, the group will cover multiple topics, including eye, face, hand, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and will see the committee plan standards and policies. On the second day, high-visibility products, instruments, and hearing protection will be discussed, while on the event&amp;#39;s final day, head protection and protective apparel will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Speakers include Jack Brown,&amp;nbsp;Arlington County&amp;rsquo;s director of emergency management, Dr. Dan Hanfling, special advisor to emergency preparedness and response with Inova Health System, and luncheon speaker Jonathon Karl, ABC News&amp;#39; senior congressional correspondent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 1, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed its top 10 most frequently cited violations at the 2011 Congress and Expo.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The ranking was presented in a demonstration by Patrick Kapust, deputy director of enforcement programs at OSHA, to a crowd on the expo&amp;#39;s floor.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; rose to the top of the list, with 7,139 violations, swapping places with last year&amp;#39;s number one, scaffolding. In 2010, 260 workers died from falls, which was once again the leading cause of death in the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scaffolding was second with 7,069 citations, with many of the accidents resulting from improper placement and setup of a scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All top 10 violations, with the number of citations issued, include:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Fall Protection &amp;ndash; 7,139&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Scaffolding &amp;ndash; 7,069&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Hazard Communication &amp;ndash; 6,538&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Respiratory Protection &amp;ndash; 3,944&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Lockout/Tagout &amp;ndash; 3,639&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Electrical, Wiring Methods &amp;ndash; 3,584&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Powered Industrial Trucks &amp;ndash; 3,432&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Ladders &amp;ndash; 3,244&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Electrical, General Requirements &amp;ndash; 2,863&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Machine Guarding &amp;ndash; 2,728&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; can help to meet OSHA standards, avoid citations, and reduce injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security"&gt;Lockout/tagout&lt;/a&gt; standards alone have resulted in the prevention of 50,000 injuries and 120 fatalities every year.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a final notice on emergency responder exposure to potentially deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Highlights include an updated list of potentially life-threatening diseases, including illnesses that have recently emerged, with specifications on infectious diseases that are generally transmitted by aerosolized or airborne means.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC stated, &amp;quot;This notice sets forth CDC&amp;#39;s final list of diseases, final guidelines describing circumstances under which exposure to listed diseases may occur, and final guidelines for determining whether an exposure to the listed diseases has occurred.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The revision stemmed from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009, which mandates that emergency responders be notified if a determination is made that a victim had an infectious disease and the risk of acquiring the infectious disease was present.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Emergency response workers can help prevent the spread of infectious disease by wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;such as faceshields, protective glasses, respiratory masks, and latex or nitrile gloves while in the line of duty.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 9, 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that in 2010, the rate of nonfatal occupational injury and illness incidents that resulted in time away from work was 118 cases per 10,000 full-time workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The number indicates that injuries and illnesses in 2010 were statistically unchanged from 2009, however the total number of private industry, state and local government cases dropped by 4 percent to roughly 1.19 million. The median number of days away from work was also unchanged at eight days per year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Findings showed the incident rate for healthcare support workers increased 6 percent to 283 cases per 10,000 workers, a number Assistant Secretary of Labor David Michaels says is far too high.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is unacceptable that the workers who have dedicated their lives to caring for our loved ones when they are sick are the very same workers who face the highest risk of work-related injury and illness,&amp;quot; he stated. &amp;quot;While workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities take an enormous toll on this nation&amp;#39;s economy &amp;ndash; the toll on injured workers and their families is intolerable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers and workers need to follow all OSHA standards for the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;. By utilizing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and other protective equipment, companies can help to lower the rate of injury and illness incidents.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a rule regarding Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) for contractors and renovators to follow. The rule addresses the hazards of lead dust and chips created by sanding, cutting, and renovating areas in housing and facilities containing lead-based paint.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the EPA created the requirement to regulate activities that disturb lead-based paint in &amp;quot;target housing,&amp;quot; or homes built before 1978, and child-occupied facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The rule requires that renovators, training renovators, and dust sampling technicians undergo training activities regarding proper handling of lead-based paint dust and chips. The requirements were founded on studies conducted in part on the amount of lead dust that was released from abrasive sanding paint removal, demolition of interior plaster walls, window replacement, carpet removal, HVAC renovations, and refurbishments that use drilling or sawing into wood and plaster.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The next phases of testing included studies conducted on worker blood-lead levels in relation to renovation and remodeling activities, a retrospective study based on the relationship between children&amp;#39;s blood-lead levels and renovations and remodeling, and workers that specialized in historic building renovation and remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) states that lead overexposure is one of the most prevalent overexposures in industry, and is a leading cause of workplace illness. The agency has ranked lead overexposure as one of its highest priorities, and has developed a strategic plan to reduce the average severity of lead exposure by 15 percent over a five year period. OSHA addresses lead hazards and required personal &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; through several different standards and directives.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued a series of 12 educational videos that depict potential hazards found in the construction industry, and the safety measures that would have prevented the injuries and fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The animated videos are meant to be easily understood and were released for both workers and employers. The educational material was issued to address the problem of construction site accidents, which, on average, claim the lives of almost 800 workers every year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I urge anyone who works in the construction industry or operates a construction business to watch the videos. Share them with your co-workers and friends in the construction industry,&amp;quot; said OSHA Assistant Secretary of Labor Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;Every step we take to educate workers about their rights and the safety measures employers must take to protect workers in construction helps us avoid preventable injuries and the tragic loss of life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Michaels also encouraged construction companies to organize screenings and to share the videos on company web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The videos cover falls, sprains and strains, struck-by accidents, carbon monoxide, and excavations. Using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;can help ensure safety on a construction site. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has released a statement urging large retailers across the country to take measures to prevent worker injuries on upcoming major holiday sales, including &amp;quot;Black Friday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In 2008, one worker was trampled to death as a group of frenzied shoppers stormed the doors of a store during the Black Friday Thanksgiving sales event. After the incident, it was found that the store had not deployed proper crowd management measures recommended by &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/Crowd_Control.html" target="_blank"&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s Crowd Management FactSheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Crowd control is critical to preventing injuries and deaths,&amp;quot; said OSHA Assistant Secretary Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;These incidents can be prevented by adopting a crowd management plan, and this fact sheet provides retail employers with guidelines for avoiding injuries during the holiday shopping season.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s crowd management safety guidelines include creating an emergency plan with trained security or crowd management personnel when a large sale is expected, providing visible signs for exits and entrances, using crowd control barricades, and having a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; and an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Training workers to use AEDs and perform CPR, or employing emergency workers for the duration of the sales events are also recommended by the agency. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Although pushing the clocks back for daylight savings time (DST) may have meant an extra hour of slumber, sleep experts from Northwestern University say that even a one-hour shift can disrupt sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sleep problems are widespread and on the rise, yet many people dismiss the issue and don&amp;rsquo;t realize the consequences that can result,&amp;quot; said Hrayr Attarian, MD, a neurologist at Northwestern Memorial and associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. &amp;quot;As people reset their clocks, they should also take this opportunity to reset their sleep habits in order to avoid possible health consequences.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Attarian stated that keeping a consistent sleep schedule even though we gain an extra hour can help you avoid being sleep deprived in the days following the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With the end of DST comes darker, drowsier commutes home from work, which can pose added risks to the drive. According to Phyllis Zee, MD, PhD director of Northwestern Memorial&amp;rsquo;s Sleep Disorders Center, driving while tired can increase the amount of accidents on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a significant increase in the number of car accidents in the days following the end of Daylight Savings Time (DST), which many attribute to lack of alertness from insufficient sleep,&amp;rdquo; Zee stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is important for motorists to always keep a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; in their vehicle, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as reflective highway warning triangles and road flares to increase safety and visibility in the event of a breakdown or accident.&lt;br /&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 8, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration launched a new &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/Sharps/ucm20025647.htm" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; containing information that caregivers and patients can use to learn how to safely dispose of needles and other &amp;quot;sharps&amp;quot; found at home and work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;sharps&amp;quot; includes medical devices with sharp points that can cause injury by puncturing the skin. Devices include hypodermic needles and syringes, fingersticks found in in blood testing systems, IV needles, and connection needles.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that workers in the healthcare industry sustain roughly 385,000 sharps injuries every year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once used, sharps pose a serious health risk if disposed of improperly. Poor methods include throwing sharps in waste baskets at home or in public and flushing the devices down toilets. Such methods put sanitation workers, sewage treatment workers, janitors and other workers in related careers at risk, although appropriate use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, can help reduce that danger.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health&amp;#39;s (NIOSH&amp;#39;S) &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/stopsticks/" target="_blank"&gt;STOP STICKS Campaign&lt;/a&gt; also hopes to raise awareness and motivate healthcare workers to improve disposal procedures concerning sharps, and also to strengthen the safety culture among healthcare occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The use of sharps is also on the rise in work offices and homes, according to the FDA. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimating more than 3 billion needles and other sharps are used in homes in the U.S. each year, many states have begun to introduce regulations to protect citizens. California, for instance, has prohibited disposing of needles in household trash, while other states such as Florida, New Jersey, and New York have implemented community drop offs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safe disposal of used needles and other sharps is a public health priority,&amp;quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA&amp;rsquo;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. &amp;quot;This website provides information about how to keep used sharps from ending up in places where they could harm people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In Fort Wayne, Indiana, one electric utility has announced that several copper thefts have been reported across its service area, which have led to higher risk of injury for the company&amp;#39;s electrical workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The thieves have been going after copper wire and other pieces of equipment found on utility poles, and in cabinets and substations. The thefts present a major problem, as tampering with electrical equipment can change the way a system operates, posing a danger to both employees and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Now, Indiana Michigan Power has released a statement seeking help from the community to identify thieves. One clear indicator of authorized personnel performing work on electric infrastructure is the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;. Also, utility line employees rarely use ladders to gain access to utility poles, but rather mechanized bucket trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This issue has not been limited to Indiana. Many states, including Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, and the Carolinas have reported thefts. The Wake County, North Carolina Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office has reported 137 cases of copper thefts since January 2009, the Charlotte Observer reported.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and its affiliates are working to develop a &amp;quot;Buy Quiet&amp;quot; web tool to help employers keep hazardous noise levels to a minimum at various work sites by using quieter tools and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to Heidi Hudson and Chuck Hayden of NIOSH, &amp;quot;The process encourages a purchaser to compare the noise emission levels of differing models of equipment being purchased and, whenever possible, purchase the quieter model. &amp;#39;Buy quiet&amp;#39; provides an easy and effective method for an employer to demonstrate a commitment to the use of the best available technology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The web tool creators expect it will help change market forces so that quieter machines and equipment will be in higher demand in the construction and manufacturing industries and to motivate manufacturers to produce such items.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that hearing loss stemming from high noise levels cannot be helped by surgery or hearing aids, highlighting the importance of using &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; or ear muffs when working in a loud environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has released its report, &amp;quot;U.S. Firefighter Injuries - 2010,&amp;quot; which found that injuries in the line of duty have decreased eight percent since 2009, marking their lowest level in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Injuries in the report are categorized by duty type, exposures to infectious diseases, and how the size of a community impacts firefighter injuries in a given department.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Firefighters work in varied environments under extreme conditions that increase their risk of on-the-job death and injury,&amp;quot; said Lorraine Carli, vice president of communications for NFPA. &amp;quot;This analysis helps NFPA and local fire departments gain a better understanding of how injuries occur so fire departments can implement the best solutions to minimize inherent risks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report indicates that 71,875 firefighter injuries were reported in 2010. Of the total, 15,000, or 20.8 percent, resulted in time away from work. In addition to reported injuries, about 11,200 exposures to infectious diseases occurred, while 25,700 hazardous work conditions were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Firefighters use specialty &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; like&amp;nbsp;self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs), helmets, visors, high temperature resistant jackets and pants, boots, and gloves. With the proper review and analysis, equipment, and training, firefighting companies can help ensure safety on the job and continue reducing the number of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) has published the sixth edition of its &amp;quot;Illustrated Guide to Electrical Safety.&amp;quot; This guide is a reference to help the reader navigate through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA) recent changes to CFR 1910 Subpart S, standard Part 1, &amp;quot;Design Safety Standards for Electrical Systems,&amp;quot; and Part 2, &amp;quot;Electrical Safety-Related Work Practices.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new issue includes an easy-to-use cross-reference that allows readers to find the changes, which were made to sync OSHA requirements with those of the 2011 National Electric Code. Although the Safety Related Work Practices section was not revised by OSHA, the updated guide harmonizes with the latest National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70E standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), the new publication features several updates that have been made to Subpart S, including working clearances and guarding for low- and high-voltage electrical installation, updated wiring methods, and significant updates to classified locations and special systems. Over 130 illustrations explain the revised requirements and users of the guide are provided with information on how to implement the requirements for a safer workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA standards establish that all employees working near potential electrical hazards must be provided with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including non-conductive &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, lineman&amp;#39;s gloves, insulated tools, and arc face shields and clothing to protect workers from shock, burns, or other electricity-related injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In a recent study conducted at the Parkinson&amp;#39;s Institute in Sunnyvale, California, researchers found that workers exposed to chemicals in electrical work, industrial machinery repair, and dry cleaning showed a significantly higher risk of developing Parkinson&amp;#39;s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The team of scientists analyzed twins in which one had developed the disease, isolating the exposure to six chemicals found in such workplaces that have been linked to Parkinson&amp;#39;s. Researchers found that two of these chemicals, trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PERC), are especially hazardous.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The potential importance is great, since both solvents persist in the environment and are commonly used,&amp;quot; said Dr. Samuel Goldman, at the Parkinson&amp;#39;s Institute. &amp;quot;Parkinson&amp;#39;s was sixfold more common in twins exposed to TCE, and ninefold more common in twins exposed to TCE or PERC.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The research also took into account workplace head injuries, which are suspected to increase the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study concluded that the highest exposure was found in the industrial machinery repair and industrial worker categories.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In response to industrial chemical exposure, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets enforceable permissible exposure limits (PELs) to keep workers safe from over-exposure to hazardous chemicals. The standards include proper ventilation and the use of personal protection equipment, including&amp;nbsp;respiratory protection, protective clothing, gloves, eye and face protection, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As millions of drivers leave work the day before Thanksgiving, highways across America will be filling with families and individuals heading home for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To remind drivers to remain cautious as they drive home from work and over the weekend, the National Safety Council (NSC) has released its Thanksgiving Day Holiday Period Traffic Fatality Estimate. The 2011 Thanksgiving Day holiday begins at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, November 23, and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, November 27. In that period, the NSC estimates there will be 434 deaths, with a 90 percent confidence interval of 368 to 509 deaths.&amp;nbsp;43,400 are estimated to have injuries that are serious enough to seek help from a medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Estimates are based on data from a five-year period beginning in 2004. In 2009, the council estimated 447 deaths, while actual deaths totaled 401.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Further studies show that safety belts are 45 percent effective in preventing traffic deaths when they are used by front-seat passengers. Other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as jumper cables, flares, and reflective triangles can be carried in a vehicle as part of an emergency pack, and a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; can help increase safety in the event of a highway accident.&lt;/p&gt;

            <Text>
                &lt;p&gt;Loud noise threatens workers&amp;#39; hearing and is one of the most widely spread occupational health problems. Employees may find themselves exposed to loud short-term or steady long-term sounds, depending on the nature of their work. Employers must follow OSHA requirements to minimize the chances of temporary or permanent hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring sound exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                There are two variables that affect how powerful a sound is - intensity and duration. Some noises only last for a short period of time but reach very high decibel levels and may cause temporary hearing loss, with repeated exposures causing permanent loss. Sounds that persist for long periods of time cause permanent hearing loss over time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s hearing conservation program requires employers to monitor sound exposure to accurately identify workers exposed to noise hazards. Areas must be monitored anywhere workers are exposed to sounds at or above 85 decibels (dB) averaged over 8 working hours, or an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA). Monitoring must take exposure into account, including all continuous, intermittent, and impulsive noise within an 80 dB to 130 dB range.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When any machines are replaced or processes are altered, employers must re-test the sound levels at a facility or worksite. These changes may also require more employees to be included in a hearing protection program if the TWA of a workplace has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To keep workers healthy and safe, companies must also test employees on a regular basis to make sure that their hearing isn&amp;#39;t being harmed. This evaluation of employee hearing is called audiometric testing, and it measures changes in their ability to hear over time. OSHA requires that all personnel undergo audiometric testing within six months of their first exposures to sound levels of 85 dB TWA. From there, annual audiometric tests must be administered. This process helps employers identify which workers need hearing protection and if they need to be refitted with protection that is more appropriate for the noise level in their work area.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All testing records should be retained so that workers with hearing damage can seek medical treatment. This documentation will also help safety departments manage sound exposure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                If a worker&amp;#39;s baseline audiogram, or first audiometric test result, is different from later tests as a result of workplace noise hazards, companies must fit or refit them with adequate hearing protection. Workers exposed to 85 dB TWA sound sources must be given hearing protection. This includes providing a selection of at least one type of ear plug and one variety of ear muff.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers exposed to TWAs of 85 dB and above need to be trained annually about the dangers of spending time around loud noises. This will help to ensure that they understand the risks of being exposed to high-volume sources. Workers who are well-informed of the reasons for a hearing conservation program will be more motivated to wear their hearing protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearing conservation help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                OSHA offers free consultation services and extensive help with safety and health programs, state plans, voluntary protection programs, partnerships, alliances, and training and education.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/index.html"&gt;OSHA website&lt;/a&gt; provides additional information and help through eTools such as Expert Advisors and Electronic Compliance Assistance Tools, information on specific health and safety topics, regulations, directives, publications, videos, and other information for both employers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Keep workers safe and minimize the chance of temporary and permanent hearing loss in your workplace by monitoring noise and worker hearing, and providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and ear muffs.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has released a revised version of its tire servicing documents to include current hazards in the industry and ensure workers perform large vehicle tire maintenance safely.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The revisions address the Materials Handling and Storage standard established by OSHA that is in place to protect workers who perform single- and multi-piece rim wheel work. Revised materials include updates to the &amp;quot;Multi-piece Rim Matching Chart,&amp;quot; including an updated list of current and obsolete components.&amp;nbsp;The &amp;quot;Demounting and Mounting Procedures for Truck/Bus Tires&amp;quot; chart has also been updated to a series of two charts that cover tube-type and tubeless tires.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These updated materials will provide readily accessible information on how to prevent worker injuries and deaths from tire-servicing incidents,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA. &amp;quot;The new format and easy access will simplify compliance with the standard by helping employers provide their workers with vital servicing information.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hazards in the tire servicing industry often occur while employees attempt to repair or service mismatched tires and rims, and have led to severe head and arm injuries.&amp;nbsp;OSHA standards require that a barrier consisting of a fence, wall, or other structure be placed between a single piece rim wheel and an employee during tire inflation, to contain the rim wheel components in the event of the sudden release of the contained air of the single piece rim wheel. OSHA also requires protective &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, protective footwear, and ear protection be used when servicing tires to help avoid injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has announced it will hold a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) December 13-16, 2011, and is currently accepting nominations for individuals to serve on the committee.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The ACCSH will use the meeting to gather information needed to advise the Secretary of Labor on standards in the construction industry and other policies. At the meeting, ACCSH will hear an update from the Directorate of Construction on OSHA&amp;#39;s outreach efforts, issues with enforcement, and rulemaking projects. The agenda also provides time for updates on programs from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ACCSH members will also consider and&amp;nbsp;make recommendations on the proposed rule to update standards on head protection for construction work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA&amp;#39;s Personal Protective Equipment publication, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; can protect employees from impact and penetration hazards.&amp;nbsp;Employers are required to supply hard hats to their employees if the risk of falling objects is present, if fixed objects are head-level, or there is a possibility for accidental contact with electrical hazards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In early November, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it had finalized its plans to study the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water through an assessment directed by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Congress has requested that the EPA study the impact of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to ensure that the country can continue to utilize its vast natural gas resources in a responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The final assessment follows the entire cycle of water through the fracking process, beginning where the water is acquired, continuing through what chemicals are mixed with the water, the actual process of fracturing,&amp;nbsp;and how the water is managed after it has been used in natural gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The plan allows the Obama administration to continue its work to ensure that the country can rely on natural gas as a clean source of energy for generations to come without jeopardizing the natural resources involved in its extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for oil and gas well drilling, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; must be utilized to ensure worker safety. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;Hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, and other personal protective equipment always needs to be worn on the jobsite, while &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, including lockout/tagout systems must be used when repairs and servicing are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 30, 2011, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its new National Emphasis Program (NEP), which aims to protect chemical facility workers from catastrophic releases of highly hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Far too many workers are injured and killed in preventable incidents at chemical facilities around the country,&amp;quot; said assistant secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;This program will enable OSHA inspectors to cover chemical facilities nationwide to ensure that all required measures are taken to protect workers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new document replaces OSHA&amp;#39;s pilot NEP, which was drafted in 2009, but many of the same safety-related problems uncovered during the refinery industry NEP&amp;nbsp;were noted. OSHA chose to expand the program to a national level to increase awareness of chemical danger&amp;nbsp;so that employers will more effectively prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new guidance is a part of OSHA&amp;#39;s Process Safety Management (PSM), which provides information for general industry and construction on how to develop a process hazard analysis and requirements for preventing hazardous chemicals from being released.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When working around chemicals, OSHA requires the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as respiratory protection, gloves, protective clothing and safety goggles&amp;nbsp;to reduce employee exposure to hazards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the temperature drops, the number of colds and cases of the flu begin to rise. This isn&amp;#39;t because low temperatures weaken people&amp;#39;s immune systems. It&amp;#39;s mostly because people are inside for longer periods of time and working in close quarters with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) states that 62 million cases of the common cold occur each year, and according to its most recent survey, 22 million days of work are lost annually. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports that estimated annual direct costs of influenza are $4.6 billion. In addition, up to 111 million workdays are lost and an estimated $7 billion per year in sick days and lost productivity are lost because of the flu. Employers can help keep their employees safe from colds and the flu by instituting effective programs, educating workers, and supplying the right tools to keep them healthy and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Receiving a flu vaccine doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that a person won&amp;#39;t catch the flu or miss days from work, but it is a helpful precaution. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends two strategies when it comes to encouraging vaccinations. Employers can either host an event or encourage employees to attend one nearby. Hosting a vaccination clinic can help an employer ensure that the largest number of workers have access to the vaccine. If your company is not hosting an onsite clinic, keep workers informed about where they can get flu vaccinations outside of the workplace. Partnering with an offsite health provider, pharmacy, or clinic is a good way to promote vaccinations in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping the spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Flu vaccinations only protect against the most common strains of the virus, and colds can&amp;#39;t usually be prevented, even with good hygiene and a strong immune system. Encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick is an easy way to help prevent employees from spreading illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that workers stay home for at least 24 hours after their fevers have broken. Persistent respiratory issues such as coughing, sneezing, and runny noses should prevent workers from returning because they will likely spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Colds and the flu are transmitted by viruses, so it isn&amp;#39;t difficult to help prevent spreading with a little bit of vigilance. Hand hygiene is key - encourage employees to wash their hands frequently and ensure that they know how to wash them properly. Using soap and water, washing for at least 20 seconds, and thoroughly rinsing and drying when finished is recommended. Post signs that tell workers, visitors, and clients the steps for proper hand hygiene and cough etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Alcohol-based cleansers are effective when hand washing isn&amp;#39;t convenient. Supply moist wipes and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/hygiene-restroom-supplies/hand-cleaners-lotions-dispensers/hand-sanitizers"&gt;hand sanitizers&lt;/a&gt; that contain alcohol to help prevent the spread of illness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Coughing and sneezing are the most common ways that colds and the flu are transmitted. Promote cough and sneeze etiquette and provide tissues for all of your workers. It is also important to properly dispose of used tissues. Designate a no-touch wastebasket that&amp;#39;s only cleaned by employees with gloves who immediately wash up after emptying it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                No employee wants to get sick, so there is always a strong incentive for workers to prevent the spread of colds and the flu. A lot of the preventative work needed to do this is in their hands. To help your employees stay healthy and productive this winter:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Educate employees about vaccinations and flu symptoms&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Provide soap, water, and tissues&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Provide &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/janitorial-chemicals-equipment/janitorial-chemicals/disinfectants"&gt;disinfectant and towelettes&lt;/a&gt; so workers can clean their tools and workstations&lt;br /&gt;
                &amp;bull; Implement a flexible sick leave policy and include alternate resources, a pay policy, procedures for reporting flu symptoms, and returning to work&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) Picture It!: Safe Workplaces for Everyone photo contest was held in celebration of the agency&amp;#39;s 40th anniversary, and was open to anyone with a passion for photography.&amp;nbsp;The photo contest challenged photographers to capture strong workplace safety practices being put to use, and OSHA has now announced the winners of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Aaron Sussel of Cincinnati, Ohio, was awarded first place in the contest for his depiction of workers on the site of last year&amp;#39;s Gulf Oil Spill, who were wearing broad-rimmed hats, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The second place photo was entered by Roberto Carlos Vergara of Charlotte, NC and shows a group of workers high above the clouds secured by &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and the third place winning photo illustrates a manufacturing worker utilizing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and a face shield, and was entered by Roberto Rodriguez of Mesquite, TX. The variety of entries submitted included many instances of workers using assorted &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am thrilled by the way these photographers have so creatively captured the challenges of workplace safety and health,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA. &amp;quot;Each winning photograph tells its own powerful story of the contribution of workers to our great country&amp;#39;s success, and America, and of the vital importance of protecting their health and safety.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Werner Ladder Co. recently celebrated its role as the Official Ladder of the NCAA Basketball Championships by presenting the University of Connecticut men&amp;#39;s basketball team with the two ladders used to cut down the nets after the team won the National Championship in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Werner Ladder is proud to be able to celebrate the achievements of Coach Jim Calhoun and the University of Connecticut men&amp;rsquo;s basketball team,&amp;quot; Chris Filardi, vice president of marketing for Werner, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Werner developed the two stepladders exclusively for the NCAA, and they are uniquely sized at 9 feet, providing easy access to the net.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?skw=werner&amp;amp;st=1" target="_blank"&gt;ladders&lt;/a&gt; produced by Werner include twin step, platform, extension, tripod, and utility.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Werner is also the official ladder, and corporate partner, of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and the Women&amp;#39;s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ladders from Werner can help companies comply with rules established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which specify that employers must provide stairways and ladders where there is a break in elevation of more than 19 inches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On December 5, 2011, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force released its final long-term plan for restoring the Gulf Coast ecosystem in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The strategy was delivered by the Task Force on December 2 to President Barack Obama, who initially ordered the Task Force to be created. The group is comprised of representatives from the five states surrounding the Gulf, as well as 11 federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In drafting the plan, the Task Force asked for input from states, tribes, federal agencies, local governments, and thousands of affected citizens and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This Task Force brought together people from across the Gulf Coast in unparalleled ways to talk about how we tackle both the immediate environmental devastation, as well as the long-term deterioration that has for decades threatened the health, the environment and the economy of the people who call this place home,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since the disaster, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued between 20 and 40 safety professionals to the Gulf to help protect cleanup workers. The agency states the employers must provide workers with all required &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, boots, and coveralls, and all workers must be trained on the hazards of the job prior to taking part in the cleanup effort. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On December 5, researchers from NASA and Ohio State University briefed the American Geophysical Union on why the devastating March 11, 2011 tsunami in Japan was so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the experts, the natural disaster was a &amp;quot;long-hypothesized &amp;#39;merging tsunami&amp;#39;&amp;quot; that formed as two wave fronts came together. The findings were based on satellite images that recorded two separate waves on the day of the disaster - an event research scientist Y. Tony Song of NASA&amp;#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory says was &amp;quot;one in 10 million.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Researchers have suspected for decades that such &amp;#39;merging tsunamis&amp;#39; might have been responsible for the 1960 Chilean tsunami that killed about 200 people in Japan and Hawaii, but nobody had definitively observed a merging tsunami until now. It was like looking for a ghost,&amp;quot; he stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to devastating losses, the tsunami has left Japan with a lengthy and dangerous cleanup effort that is still ongoing, with workers facing hazards from debris piles and an affected nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the event a tsunami comes to the United States, many government agencies including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have developed emergency preparedness and response&amp;nbsp;guidelines to prepare for such a disaster and the related cleanup. These guidelines include requirements for cleanup workers to wear proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, protective clothing, and respiratory protection. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) recently issued its Safety Advisory 2011-03 to remind railroad bridge workers, contractors or subcontractors to a railroad of the dangers of crossing unsecured sections of walkways and platform gratings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The advisory contains a number of recommendations for employers and urges that &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; be used to decrease the number of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The regulations require railroads and railroad contractors to provide, and employees to use, fall protection and personal protective equipment, including head, foot, eye, and face equipment,&amp;quot; the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;FRA regulations require that a personal fall arrest safety device or safety net be used when bridge workers perform duties 12 feet or higher above the ground or water. Appropriate systems can consist of an anchorage, connectors, body harness, lanyard, deceleration device, lifeline, or a combination of these components.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Preliminary investigations conducted by the FRA found that although some exceptions apply to these regulations, none of the recently reported accidents were found to be exempt from fall protection standards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has worked through it&amp;#39;s National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) partnership program to develop and release the National Services Agenda which includes safety and health goals for auto repair services to strive toward.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The automotive repair and maintenance industry has more than 1.3 million workers nationwide, which include automobile dealerships, general repair, and specialty shops. While these workplaces may not have safety professionals on staff, injury and illness risks can be reduced by adopting effective hazard controls and safe work practices.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers can also lead a work group to discuss major issues about hazards in the industry, develop a system to better track occupational injuries and illnesses, and provide input to NORA to further develop more safety goals for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NORA&amp;#39;s Services Sector Council&amp;nbsp;created strategic goals within the auto repair industry, and plans to track accomplishments through 2016.&amp;nbsp;NORA stated that to achieve these goals partnerships are necessary to encourage the creation of comprehensive occupational safety and health programs, analyze potential exposures to hazardous materials, and to develop effective training programs to help employees recognize and control hazardous material in auto repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;​As a part of these automotive repair health and safety&amp;nbsp;goals, the National Services Agenda has listed important issues, including cuts, lacerations, bruises, and exposure to chemicals, exhaust, and asbestos.&amp;nbsp;Businesses can reduce risks of injuries with the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory protection, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On December 14, 2011, the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions will hold an executive session to take up nominations and S. 1855, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act Reauthorization of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The bill is a reauthorization that built on the 2006 law that sought to increase public health preparedness in the event of a pandemic or similar health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Senator Richard Burr first sponsored the bill on November 10, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The American people expect us to do all that we can to prevent an attack and, if one should occur, be fully prepared to respond, including having safe and effective medical countermeasures readily available,&amp;quot; Burr said on the bill&amp;#39;s introduction. &amp;quot;This legislation redoubles our efforts to protect the American people by strengthening our existing programs and making targeted improvements in areas in which we know we must do better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has drafted guidance on preparing workplaces for an influenza pandemic, which recommends that employers encourage their workers to engage in proper hygiene such as, proper hand washing and cough etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hand Sanitizers, tissues, and proper work practices may help prevent an outbreak, but once the disease has been identified, gloves, face masks and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; can be effective in controlling the spread of certain viruses. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) held its Tornado and Severe Weather Workshop and Symposium December 13-15, 2011, in Norman, Oklahoma, titled &amp;quot;Weather Ready Nation Reducing Impacts from Nature&amp;#39;s Most Violent Storms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The event sought to initiate a discussion among the user, service, and science communities to develop actions to improve America&amp;#39;s preparedness and resilience in the event of severe weather and to protect lives and property.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the workshop, participants worked to improve user-driven, impact-based forecasts by discussing how to integrate best practices from warning and risk communication. The event led the group to identify advancements in longer-term outlooks and how they relate to preparedness, and also outlined pilot projects within communities that involve NOAA and other government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) Tornado Response/Recovery guidelines state several hazards are associated with severe weather cleanup. Slips and falls, falling debris, electrical hazards, and burns are all hazards faced by recovery workers, however use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and boots, can help reduce the risk of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;MedPro Safety survey finds that 68 percent of healthcare workers believe needlestick injuries are still a major threat in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The survey took responses from 262 healthcare professionals at the APIC 2011 Annual Educational Conference in June 2011, which found that 68 percent stated they believe that syringe needlestick injuries have not been eliminated despite requirements established over a decade ago by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another 43 percent stated they do not believe the safety measures developed by the agencies to prevent needlesticks are activated after use and before disposal at their institutions. An additional 43 percent indicated they were not happy or ambivalent with the syringes used by their institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The findings suggested a high degree of concern in the medical field about the present risk of needlestick injuries and the measures that are in place to control them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, about 385,000 sharps injuries occur to hospital employees every year. Workers can reduce the risk of such injuries by following OSHA&amp;#39;s requirements, which include safer needle devices and proper handling and disposal. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt;, like puncture-resistant &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, are also beneficial for employees handling sharps disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;To keep holiday drunk driving accidents to a minimum this year, Safety Daily Advisor has reminded workers that December is National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;December may be a good time to give workers a brief reminder of the dangers of driving after drinking at holiday parties and other events. According to the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse, the &amp;quot;skills and coordination needed for driving are compromised long before the obvious signs of intoxication are visible,&amp;quot; marking the importance of discussing the appropriate amount of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Discussing alcohol use in general may be beneficial for employees, and can help with informed decision making. Debunking common myths about &amp;quot;sobering up,&amp;quot; including the idea that a strong cup of coffee will sober up a motorist to an acceptable blood-alcohol level for driving can also be a good discussion point.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 10,228 people were killed in drunk driving accidents in 2010. Drunk driving also endangers highway workers and commercial truck drivers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) notes that transportation incidents accounted for about two-fifths of all workplace deaths in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To lower the risk of injury, flaggers and other workers in the right-of-way must always wear high visibility vests and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). All vehicles should be equipped with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; and first aid kits in the event of an accident and, as a driver, stay alert, concentrate, and drive defensively. Being aware of other drivers and their actions, and responding appropriately can get you safely home for the holidays. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Injuries like sprains or bruises can usually be treated with cold. Cold compresses are ideal for different types of injuries and workers should know when to use a cold compress if a co-worker has been hurt. Instant cold packs are best for including in a first aid kit for use around a worksite when dealing with minor injuries.They don&amp;#39;t require refrigeration and can be used right away.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A recent injury such as an ankle sprain, twisted wrist or ankle, impact injury, bruise, insect bite, or minor bump on the head is usually best treated with an instant cold pack. Cold compresses help reduce pain and swelling in these injuries, help limit further damage by constricting the blood flow in the area, and they make the injury feel better. They are also helpful in cases of heat stress and heat exhaustion when placed in armpits or used as a cold compress to the head, neck, or face.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When using a cold pack, it is important to avoid making an injury worse. Ice packs should be used for 20 minutes at a time - 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. Remove the cold pack if your skin or your injury gets uncomfortable, and reapply when you feel comfortable again.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health&amp;#39;s (NIOSH&amp;#39;s) Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program launched its own &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/NIOSHFACE" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter page&lt;/a&gt; on August 8, 2011.&amp;nbsp;The new page will be used to raise awareness of the FACE program, according to Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;amp;S).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Twitter page is a part of the institute&amp;#39;s FACE research program, which began in 1982. The program works to identify and study fatal injuries that occur in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The page&amp;#39;s first three tweets were in response to crane rigger fatalities, a topic of concern that will be addressed on August 31, 2011, at a virtual event to be held by Occupational Health and Safety. The tweets will focus on highlighting investigations that seek to target causes of death, involving confined spaces, machine-related fatalities, falls, and electrocutions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Another tweet recently posted offers information on &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; when working on precast concrete floor slabs. Other initial tweets included information on hazards faced by crane workers, crossing guards, electricians, and others. FACE is currently investigating deaths involving machinery, energy production, and construction falls.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OROSHA&amp;#39;s) December newsletter discusses ways supervisors can better promote safety in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The newsletter begins by discussing some of America&amp;#39;s most tragic workplace accidents, including the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire that occurred 100 years ago. The accident, which led to the death of 146 workers, was said to have been made worse by locked exit doors. Agency Administrator Michael Wood stated the event displayed &amp;quot;employers taking unacceptable risks with the lives of their workers in order to prevent pilferage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency stated that safety can be greatly improved with better supervisor-employer relationships. OROSHA&amp;#39;s requirements state that all employers are responsible for the safe performance of the work under their supervision, the safe conduct of the crew, and the safety of all workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Poor supervision can&amp;nbsp;lead to confusion about safe practices and responsibilities, and put workers at risk for injury,&amp;nbsp;the newsletter stated. It is up to a supervisor to explain safety requirements and how they relate to the job at hand to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Supervisor responsibility includes training employees on safety requirements that apply to their jobs, including hazards, safety rules, and the proper use of required &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently allowed the marketing of the first device to be developed that can aid in the detection of life-threatening bleeding in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The machine, called the Infrascanner Model 1000, can be used by healthcare providers to identify the severity of head trauma when an immediate brain imaging study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While patients with suspected brain injuries routinely receive a CT scan, this portable device offers emergency room physicians a non-invasive mechanism to aid in assessing whether an immediate CT scan is needed,&amp;quot; said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at FDA&amp;rsquo;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), head injuries caused by contact with objects and equipment lead to 15,000 occupational injuries in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide workers with personal protective equipment, which includes ensuring the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, that can help protect workers from traumatic brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board NTSB has made an unprecedented move in recommending that the use of all personal electronic devices (PEDs) be banned while behind the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The action came during a December 13, 2011 board meeting regarding a multi-vehicle highway accident in a construction zone, which injured a total of 38 people and killed two others. The accident was determined to be caused by texting while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The recommendation calls for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to ban all non-emergency use of PEDs, and also urges the use of high-visibility enforcement and a series of targeted communication campaigns to inform drivers&amp;nbsp;of such a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the last two decades, there has been exponential growth in the use of cell-phone and personal electronic devices,&amp;quot; the NTSB noted in a statement, adding that a recent Virginia Tech study found a safety-critical event was 163 times more likely to occur if a driver is texting, emailing or on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there were 968 fatal occupational highway incidents in 2010, comprising 21 percent of all occupational fatalities. To help lower the risk of injury or death, highway workers should wear and use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as high-visibility safety vests and traffic safety cones, when working near oncoming cars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Promoting a successful safety culture, a term which Safety Daily Advisor calls &amp;quot;the set of values that management and the workforce use to determine how they act at work,&amp;quot; should go further than being a priority, as priorities tend to be rearranged depending on companies&amp;#39; needs, according to safety professional James Roughton.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Instead, it should be a part of everyday work, he said, and can be attained in just a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By studying previous accidents, employers can see all factors that led up to the incident, rather than as an isolated occurrence. Once the risks are assessed, integrating safety activities into existing standards, instead of creating new ones, will aid in worker compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Involving workers and applauding noticeable improvements can go a long way. When there is an accident, start thinking about the current process of recognizing hazards and how to control them, and focus on the ways the system can be improved. A safety culture can grow and succeed as management endorses change and provides repetitive training, enforcement, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Also outlined by Roughton was the importance of identifying and measuring all costs associated with workplace injuries and finding ways to manage and reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Developing a safety culture also includes various safety and compliance systems, such as the use and continual monitoring of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On December 16, 2011, Safety Daily Advisor highlighted the importance of hard hat safety in initial training of employees, as well as in refresher training courses.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees should be trained to select a hard hat that is appropriate for the task at hand and protects against existing hazards. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;Hard hats&lt;/a&gt; are rated by type and class, which workers should understand when making a selection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Type I helmets provide top impact protection, while Type II hard hats provide protection against top and side impacts. Class E are tested to withstand 20,000 volts. Class G is tested to 2,200 volts, while Class C does not provide any protection from electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers are also encouraged to explain that workers must inspect hard hats for damage and wear before and after every use, adjust the headband to an appropriately fitting position, and clean the helmet occasionally. Also include training on when a hard hat needs to be replaced, including if it has been involved in an impact, is cracked, broken, or punctured, or if the suspension&amp;#39;s headband is worn or stretched out.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) enters into its second century, president Terrie S. Norris has issued a call for more action to the occupational safety, health, and environmental profession.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As we move into the next 100 years of protecting people, property and the environment, we face many challenges,&amp;quot; Norris said. &amp;quot;Despite the dedicated efforts of ASSE&amp;rsquo;s members, employers, workers, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the fact that fatalities are not significantly decreasing should be a call for action, not complacency.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Norris added that businesses need to be reminded to resist cutting back on occupational safety and health systems. He also noted that stakeholders in occupational safety and health need to work together to make sure the economy, jobs, and corporate bottom lines can benefit from a safe and healthy workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 4,547 workers were killed on the job in 2010, compared to 4,551 the year before. Norris stated that this &amp;quot;statistical plateau&amp;quot; of worker deaths is not an achievement, and more must be done to protect American workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To help prevent workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses, OSHA requires employers to provide employees with proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; relevant to the job being performed. This personal protective equipment can include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) recently announced that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has approved an updated version of the ANSI/ASSE A10.33-2011 standard, Safety and Health Program Requirements for Multi-Employer Projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The standard establishes the minimum elements and activities a program must have in order to define construction employers&amp;#39; duties and responsibilities on a site where multiple employers will be doing the work. It will be used as a minimum safety and health guideline to develop a safe and healthy worksite and the most cost-effective construction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This revised standard for multi-employers should reinforce the importance of proper planning, effective execution, and safety on construction and demolition jobsites,&amp;quot; said Richard King, Certified Safety Professional and chair of the A10 Committee. &amp;quot;We continue to work to enhance work safety and health on construction sites.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This standard is one in a series created by the A10 Accredited Standards Committee to guide contractors, workers, and equipment manufacturers in the construction and demolition industries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Construction is considered a high hazard industry and to protect workers at multi-employer worksites from falling from rooftops, unguarded machinery, being struck by heavy construction equipment, and electrocutions, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;American auto manufacturers had much to show for at the recent North American International Auto Show in Detroit, as all agreed the domestic auto manufacturing industry has been reborn and is ready to meet the soaring domestic demand for cars.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation, predicted sales of U.S. cars will grow to 14 million in 2012, compared to an expected finish of 12.7 million vehicles in 2011, and up from 11.6 million sold in 2010. J.D. Power and LMC Automotive have similar estimates, forecasting sales of 13.8 million vehicles in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Center for Automotive Research (CAR) expects General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler to add 30,000 hourly and salaried positions by 2015, while total employment in the auto manufacturing and supply industry is expected to grow 28 percent in the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To ensure the safety of workers in the automobile manufacturing industry employers are required to provide proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reaffirmed its position on protecting workers from injury and illness by presenting a white paper that that calls its programs &amp;quot;effective, flexible and commonsense&amp;quot; tools.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The white paper discusses the agency&amp;#39;s injury and illness prevention programs (I2P2), and cites many examples and studies on how I2P2 has helped reduce injury, illness, and workplace fatalities and increased productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An I2P2 is a process that helps employers proactively identify and fix hazards before employees are hurt. Currently, 34 states require or encourage such programs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The key elements common to all of these programs are management leadership, worker participation, hazard identification and assessment, hazard prevention and control, education and training, and program evaluation and improvement,&amp;quot; notes the introduction to the &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/safetyhealth/OSHAwhite-paper-january2012sm.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Injury and Illness Prevention Programs White Paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Companies that have already implemented the programs at their work sites have experienced &amp;quot;dramatic decreases&amp;quot; in workplace injuries, and have also reported a new workspace culture that may lead to higher quality work, lower turnover, lower costs, and more overall employee satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, such programs require the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that protect workers from the hazards presented. Such items may include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, or other forms of personal protective equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On November 20, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed three new cases of a novel strain of influenza in Iowa, bringing the total number of cases of the strain to 10 since July.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The virus, known as swine-origin triple reassortant influenza A (H3N2), has shown to be resistant to some forms of vaccines, and has appeared in Pennsylvania, Maine, Indiana, and now Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;No data has been found to show that the transmission of this strain will occur differently than a seasonal influenza virus. The CDC has advised that control principles and actions taken for seasonal influenza infections are also fitting for the control of A(H3N2)v.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Current CDC research indicates that seasonal vaccines may provide limited protection against infection with A(H3N2)v viruses among adults, but they provide no protection for children. The CDC does recommend the use of vaccines and states, &amp;quot;They remain the best tool for the prevention of seasonal influenza transmission in health care settings, which is currently the greatest risk from influenza during this influenza season.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), workers can protect themselves from the seasonal flu by utilizing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/hygiene-restroom-supplies/hand-cleaners-lotions-dispensers/hand-sanitizers" target="_blank"&gt;hand sanitizers&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/janitorial-chemicals-equipment/janitorial-chemicals/disinfectants" target="_blank"&gt;disinfectant and towelettes&lt;/a&gt;. Coughs and sneezes should always be covered with a tissue or directed into the upper sleeve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) recently announced that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has approved two new A10 construction and demolition safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One new standard, ANSI/ASSE A10.1-2011 Project and Pre-Task Safety and Health Planning for Construction and Demolition Operations, will establish the elements and activities that take place before and after safety and health planning for construction sites. The second, ANSI/ASSE A10.26-2011 Procedures for Construction and Demolition Sites, applies to emergency procedures involving fires, collapses, hazardous spills and other emergencies.&amp;nbsp;The A10.26 standard also addresses emergency rescue, on-site first aid and emergency care, evacuation of injured or ill workers, and training on emergency plans and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The A10 standards play an important role in providing technical guidance to the construction and demolition industry in order to prevent occupational fatalities, injuries, and illnesses,&amp;rdquo; said Richard King, chair of the A10 Committee. &amp;quot;These two new standards build upon our existing documents to enhance work safety and health on construction sites.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), construction is a high-hazard industry that presents workers with safety risks including falling from heights, unguarded machinery, being struck by heavy equipment, and electrocutions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of such accidents, employers must provide their workers with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In a recent article, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) outlined the necessary steps Americans should take to avoid coming down with the flu this season.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The best thing anyone can do to fend off the flu virus is to get a flu vaccine, but there are many supplementary actions that can be taken to help keep the flu at bay. Exercise has shown to be highly beneficial in warding off the virus. A recent study showed adults who exercised regularly during flu season spent 43 percent fewer days with an upper respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The amount of sleep people get each night is another indicator of how susceptible they may be to the virus. According to the National Sleep Foundation, sleep deprivation leads to less effective immune systems, lowering the body&amp;#39;s defenses against the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In close quarters such as a work place, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that doorknobs, phones, and other objects regularly be cleaned with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/janitorial-chemicals-equipment/janitorial-chemicals/disinfectants" target="_blank"&gt;disinfectant wipes&lt;/a&gt;. In the office, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/hygiene-restroom-supplies/hand-cleaners-lotions-dispensers/hand-sanitizers" target="_blank"&gt;hand sanitizers&lt;/a&gt;, tissues, and proper work practices can help keep the virus from spreading among employees, ensuring a productive and healthy environment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which are the first aimed to protect Americans from the emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants.&amp;nbsp;The new standards will rely on proven pollution controls that are widely available to reduce emissions. More than half of the coal-fired power plants in the nation are already using these pollution controls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The EPA estimates that the new standards will prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths and 4,700 heart attacks each year. They are also expected to help children grow up healthier, possibly preventing 130,000 cases of childhood asthma and about 6,300 fewer cases of acute bronchitis each year.&amp;nbsp;The total economic and health benefits of their implementation are estimated at $90 billion dollars annually.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With these standards that were two decades in the making, EPA is rounding out a year of incredible progress on clean air in America with another action that will benefit the American people for years to come,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The EPA also estimates that manufacturing, engineering, installing, and maintaining the pollution controls to meet these standards will provide employment for thousands. Potential employment includes up to 46,000 short-term construction jobs and 8,000 long-term utility jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many standards have been set for workers in the electric power generation, transmission, and distribution industry. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that all electric grid workers wear &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, face shields, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, insulating gloves with protectors, and flame-resistant (FR) clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released its 2010 analysis of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which assesses the impact of toxic chemical disposals and other releases into the environment, and also provides information on waste management and pollution prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The publication found that total releases including disposals for 2010 are higher than the previous two years but lower than 2007 and all years before. Many of the releases from TRI facilities were under the regulation of the EPA&amp;#39;s programs and requirements that were developed to decrease human and environmental harm.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said TRI is an important aspect of the EPA&amp;#39;s community-right-to-know programs. The information found in the study is used by citizens, emergency planners, and public health figures to make crucial decisions about their community&amp;#39;s safety and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has published several guidelines regarding the response to dangers posed by hazardous waste. Such standards include emergency action plans, exit routes and fire prevention plans, as well as the use of personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To maintain a safe workplace when disposing of toxic chemicals, provide &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as safety goggles, protective clothing, and respiratory protection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In response to a recent chemical fire and fatality, Chemical Safety Board (CSB) Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso has urged the Environmental Technology Council (ETC) to petition the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) to issue a specific hazardous waste standard that would provide guidance to treatment, storage, and disposal facilities that handle such materials.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most recent incident resulted in a flash fire that occurred when workers were attempting to split large solid waste drums of flammable inorganic chemicals into smaller drums.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unfortunately accidents at hazardous waste processing facilities are all too common,&amp;quot; said Moure-Eraso in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;The standard would provide guidance to prevent the occurrence of fires, explosions, and releases at these types of facilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As an independent federal agency, the CSB investigates chemical accidents, including those caused by equipment failures, inadequate regulations, industry standards, and safety management systems. The ETC is a hazardous waste industry trade group consisting of people inside and outside of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that exchange information and review technology solutions for environmental problems. NFPA develops fire prevention codes and standards that may be incorporated into Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In its efforts to help protect hazardous waste workers, OSHA&amp;#39;s Hazardous Waste Standards state that all workers must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes totally-encapsulated chemical protective suits, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and all general &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On January 12, 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced it had selected 10 OSHA authorized training providers to instruct 25 online courses in line with its Outreach Training Program.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program was developed to teach employees how to identify, prevent, and eliminate hazards that exist in the workplace. It also ensures all workers understand their rights, and employers know their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are pleased to announce the selection of these online training providers,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA Dr. David Michaels. &amp;quot;These high-quality online courses will allow a greater number of workers to receive valuable interactive training supported by safety professionals - especially in remote areas with limited access to standard classrooms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The courses are not required by OSHA, but the training they provide can help workers and employers create a safe and healthy workplace. For specific hazards related to their job, workers also need to receive additional, focused training.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The courses will provide instruction in Construction, General Industry, and Maritime in either 10- or 30-hour classes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Developing a safe and healthy work site includes the use of OSHA-required &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, which include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently announced updates to its Federal Agency Targeting Inspection Program (FEDTARG) directive for fiscal 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The directive provides guidance on programmed inspections of federal agency establishments reporting high numbers of injuries that led to time away from work in 2011. The update outlines the procedures of conducting these inspections. Any establishments that reported 100 or more lost-time cases in fiscal 2011 will be inspected by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Other updates include provisions for reviewing alternative and supplementary standards, as well as clarifications on how OSHA Area Directors determine the number and location of site-specific inspections for establishments with more than one service or operation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;FEDTARG 2012 will help OSHA continue its nationwide inspection campaign of federal work sites. The program first started in 2008 after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended OSHA develop a specific inspection program for federal workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When inspecting work sites, OSHA covers a wide range of standards, including ensuring proper use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently joined Illinois utility ComEd to announce the company&amp;#39;s new investment plan that will pump $1.1 billion into building smart grid technologies that will bring the state&amp;#39;s aging infrastructure into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This year, ComEd will begin the infrastructure upgrades, digitizing the electric grid, and installing smart meter technologies in the homes of its customers. The project will create more than 2,400 jobs in Chicago in construction, engineering, IT, dispatching, and equipment distribution, with 350-400 jobs created in the next year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re modernizing Chicago&amp;rsquo;s electric infrastructure and building a Smart Grid that will bring significant economic opportunity for the City, adding jobs and creating new facilities that will train Chicagoans to contribute to Chicago&amp;rsquo;s growing green economy and help Chicago families save money on electricity,&amp;quot; Emanuel stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new projects will be required to follow standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which state that all employees working in areas that may have potentially dangerous electrical hazards must be provided with and use &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; designed specifically for the work that is to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Such protective equipment includes &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; and nonconductive &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, as well as gloves, tools, and other properly insulated protective products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Bloodborne pathogens can be a risk factor in many workplaces, and implementing specific safety guidelines helps ensure the protection of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), bloodborne pathogens are infectious microorganisms within the blood that cause disease in humans. Workers in many occupations, including first aid team members, housekeeping workers in some industries, nurses, and other healthcare personnel may be exposed to such organisms and can be at risk for serious and fatal illnesses. Other industries with high injury rates and possible exposure are manufacturing and construction. Consider the following information to promote safe and healthy sanitary practices at your worksite.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling contaminated sharps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                When workers handle sharps any cut or needlestick may present a risk. Objects that are contaminated with chemicals, microorganisms, or other potentially infectious materials (OPIMs) should be disposed of in &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/biohazard/biohazard-clean-up-disposal/sharps-disposal-containers" target="_blank"&gt;sharps disposal containers&lt;/a&gt;, OSHA explains. Any room or area in which sharp or contaminated objects are being used should have a sharps disposal container in the vicinity. These containers must be puncture-resistant, have leakproof sides and bottoms, and be color-coded red as a warning that it contains hazardous materials. OSHA requires employers to use safer medical devices when possible. Safe medical devices can be needleless or have protection against contact with the sharp built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used when exposed to or working with sharps or contaminated equipment. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as gloves, lab coats, face shields or masks, and eye protection help keep workers safe. Of these, gloves are one of the most important pieces of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; to use when handling contaminated or hazardous material. OSHA states, &amp;quot;If it can be reasonably expected that a worker could have hand contact with blood, OPIM, or contaminated surfaces or items, the employer must ensure that the worker wears gloves. Single-use gloves cannot be washed or decontaminated for reuse. Utility gloves may be decontaminated if their ability to provide an effective barrier is not compromised. They should be replaced when they show signs of cracking, peeling, tearing, puncturing, or
                deteriorating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If a worker is allergic to standard latex or powdered gloves, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/hand-protection/disposable-and-chemical-resistant-gloves/vinyl" target="_blank"&gt;powder-free vinyl gloves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/hand-protection/disposable-and-chemical-resistant-gloves/nitrile" target="_blank"&gt;powder-free nitrile gloves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workplace accident response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                A first aid program is an important part of a safety and health management system and includes hazard identification, prevention, and control to minimize the outcome of accidents or exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA requires employers to have &amp;quot;trained first aid providers at all workplaces of any size if there is no infirmary, clinic, or hospital in near proximity to the workplace which is used for the treatment of all injured employees&amp;quot; and medical supplies that correspond to the hazards of the workplace. A first aid provider in the workplace is someone with training that can provide initial medical emergency procedures. This responder would perform a first assessment and intervention until emergency medical services (EMS) arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting an incident&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                If a worker is injured or reports a bloodborne pathogen exposure incident, such as a needlestick, address the issue immediately and have the worker medically evaluated. This ensures that the individual is immediately treated and that other workers aren&amp;#39;t affected by the exposure. The medical evaluation and follow-up of the exposed worker must be confidential, and provided to the worker with no medical charges in relation to the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Following the standards set by OSHA and addressing exposure incidents swiftly will help ensure your workplace remains safe.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;As the largest sporting event in America draws closer, it&amp;#39;s a good time to bring the hard-hitting facts about head injuries to light - on the field and at a worksite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Former Dallas Cowboys tailback Tony Dorsett recently announced his decade-long career in the NFL has created significant health problems in retirement, most notably due to head injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Dorsett described to the The Associated Press the hardest hit he ever took in his career, which left him unconscious on the field.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That ain&amp;#39;t the first time I was knocked out or been dazed over the course of my career, and now I&amp;#39;m suffering for it,&amp;quot; Dorsett stated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The importance of head protection is also being discussed in youth football, as some 3.5 million kids between the ages of 6 and 13 play the sport, according to an independent report conducted by former NBC news anchor Stone Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you think about the number of people playing the game, and where we need to be focused in terms of safety and exposure to risk, certainly more work needs to be done here,&amp;quot; he told TV Newser following the release of his investigative report.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;When workers are looking to support their team and protect their head in hazardous conditions, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/7124/NFL-Team-Hard-Hat?skw=7124" target="_blank"&gt;NFL team hard hats&lt;/a&gt; are available. These rugged &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; feature superior impact resistance while sporting the colors and logo of their favorite team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On January 20, 2012, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was looking for applications to provide assistance to agricultural producers and small businesses to perform various energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Renewable energy development presents an enormous economic opportunity for rural America,&amp;quot; said Vilsack. &amp;quot;This funding will assist rural farmers, ranchers and business owners to build renewable energy projects, providing opportunities for new technologies, create green jobs and help America become more energy self-sufficient.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Funding for these projects is available through the USDA&amp;#39;s Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The program was created to help the nation meet its critical energy needs and to help rural businesses and agricultural producers reduce their energy consumption and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more green jobs appear and the use of alternative fuel sources, such as biofuels, becomes more common, employers must be aware of the standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Green job hazards in the biofuels industry include fire/explosion hazards and chemical reactivity and toxicity hazards in the manufacturing of biofuel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: normal;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;inimize these risks by implementing&amp;nbsp;procedures for using appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance/lockout-tagout-security" target="_blank"&gt;lockout/tagout&lt;/a&gt; devices while servicing or repairing equipment and ensure workers wear proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as protective clothing, head and face protection, and respiratory protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As the demand for low-carbon, domestically sourced fuels increases, employers will need to comply with such standards to ensure the safety of all workers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently announced that construction-related accidents in the city dropped by 18 percent in 2011, and injuries related to construction dropped 7.8 percent, which the Mayor attributed to safety measures enacted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Last year, five accidents resulted in deaths, which were documented as the result of improper safety procedures. Construction-related accidents dropped to 128 in 2011 from 157 the year before, and construction-related injuries fell from 165 in 2010 to 152 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Even as construction activity rose by nearly 8 percent last year, the number of construction-related accidents fell,&amp;quot; Bloomberg told reporters at a construction site in Queens.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The most common construction accident in 2011 was workers falling from heights, but the number of workers who were injured in a fall dropped from 66 in 2010 to 52 in 2011, a 21 percent decline.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To help ensure that construction accidents and injuries continue to decline, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued requirements to help employers confront the many hazards present in the construction industry, and require the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Industrial production grew 0.4 percent in December 2011, after falling 0.3 percent the previous month. December helped fourth-quarter manufacturing totals rise at an annual rate of 3.1 percent, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly gain.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The manufacturing sector alone grew 0.9 percent in December, while both durables and nondurables saw similar advances. Total industrial production reached 95.3 percent of its 2007, pre-recession average, rising 2.9 percent above 2010&amp;#39;s levels.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Manufacturing remains an engine of growth,&amp;quot; said John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at State Street Global Markets LLC in Boston. &amp;quot;Manufacturing has benefited from exports to emerging markets. The more resilient those economies are, the better it is for U.S. manufacturing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Higher output means more workers are going to work in more factories. Keep workers protected from hazards by following standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) including the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by a researcher at the University of California, Davis has found that occupational injuries and illnesses cost the nation about $250 billion every year, much higher than previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study suggests the U.S. should focus more on reducing work-related injuries and illnesses, considering the costs have risen by more than $33 billion, adjusting for inflation, since a study conducted in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The costs are enormous and continue to grow,&amp;quot; said J. Paul Leigh, professor of public health sciences at UC Davis and author of the study. &amp;quot;And the potential for health risks are high, given that most people between the ages 22 to 65 spend 40 percent of their waking hours at work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and advises that benefits of a strong commitment to workplace safety and health could provide economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NIOSH Director John Howard, M.D. states, &amp;quot;Gaining a better understanding of the burden helps NIOSH and our partners make the case that preventing work-related injuries and illnesses is part of a wise national strategy for economic recovery and growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers can help lower the amount of workplace injuries and illnesses by complying with regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&amp;nbsp;These regulations include the use of appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; at work, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Harnesses-Lanyards" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety harness&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, to reduce exposure to workplace hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has teamed up with the National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA) for a second year and announces a supplemental issue of the International Journal of Audiology.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The issue highlights research presented at NHCA&amp;#39;s 36th Annual Conference. The studies include potential roadblocks to implementing engineering noise controls in the manufacturing sector, the sources of noise in daily working life, and how different &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and ear muffs, perform across a wide range of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The ability to hear can greatly impact a worker&amp;#39;s ability to do their job as well as their quality of life,&amp;quot; said NIOSH Director Dr. John Howard. &amp;quot;Understanding the causes and how to effectively prevent noise-induced hearing loss is an important priority for NIOSH as we continue to look at total worker health.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states approximately 30 million people in the U.S. are exposed to hazardous noise in the workplace every year. Noise-related hearing loss is one of the most prevalent workplace health concerns in the country, as thousands of workers every year suffer from hearing loss that could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has announced that in October 2011, the refinery field of distillate fuels, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil, hit 29.7 percent. This ties the previous record that was set in December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Distillate yields have followed their upward trend since 2001, before reaching their peak in 2008. Yields were on an upward trend again in 2011. The recent growth in distillate yield is attributed to much higher price margins over the cost of crude oil for distillate compared to gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The higher yield is also due to growing distillate exports, which hit a record of 1,067 thousand barrels per day in October 2011. The average U.S. refinery has about 1.5 times as much gasoline as distillate from each barrel of refined.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers in the oil and gas well drilling industry must follow standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in order to minimize worker exposure to hazards. These guidelines include the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including&amp;nbsp;respiratory protection, head protection, and eye and face protection such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is celebrating its 150th anniversary. President Abraham Lincoln enacted a law that established the agency in 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In what Lincoln described as &amp;quot;The People&amp;#39;s Department,&amp;quot; the USDA was formed when about half of all U.S. citizens lived on farms. Although that number has dropped to only 2 percent, the USDA&amp;#39;s work on food, agriculture, economic development, science, and natural resources is still fulfilling Lincoln&amp;#39;s vision, affecting the lives of Americans every day.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was true 150 years ago - remains true today - agriculture and rural America matter,&amp;quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack remarked at the American Farm Bureau Federation annual meeting on January 9, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The USDA has addressed the changing needs of the industry throughout the years, working to ensure a safe food supply and providing a healthy environment for agricultural workers. The agency encourages the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1&amp;amp;m_show=96&amp;amp;q=usda" target="_blank"&gt;USDA-approved items&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;shelving&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;units, hand sanitizers, cleaners, containers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Vilsack concluded his speech by affirming the American agricultural industry is set to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the 20th century, farmers and rural Americans helped to build the strongest nation on earth,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;At the beginning of the 21st Century, farmers and rural Americans are helping again to strengthen America so it may continue for this century to be the freest, safest, greatest nation on earth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 7, 2012, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced there were 3.4 million job openings across the country in December, up from 3.1 million the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The numbers mark a continued upward trend since the U.S. began its slow climb out of the recession in June 2009. Although the number of job openings in December was still below the 4.4 million openings that were reported before the recession took hold in 2007, it has increased 39 percent since June 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the construction industry, there were 71,000 job openings in December 2011, compared to 44,000 in the same month the year before. Manufacturing job openings increased from 242,000 in November to 264,000 in December, compared to the 184,000 manufacturing industry job openings in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more jobs become available in industries such as construction and manufacturing, more workers will be regularly exposed to large equipment, loud machines, and other safety hazards. Equip new hires&amp;nbsp;with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, when working near occupational hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;High-visibility protective vests are required for right-of-way workers, flaggers, and adult crossing guards by standards in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) uses as a basis for their regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;These garments must be compliant with ANSI/ISEA 107, the American National Standard for High-Visibility Public Safety Vests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The revision to the MUTCD in 2009 requires public safety vests to be labeled&amp;nbsp;as compliant with the 2006 standard, or any further changes to the version. ANSI approved the revision in 2011, leading the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) to seek an interpretation from the FHWA that &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; vests meeting the new standard would be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;ISEA claimed that the requirements of the two standards for daytime and nighttime visibility lacked any major difference.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;FHWA agreed with ISEA, and has released an official interpretation that the ANSI/ISEA 207-2011 standard is equivalent to the 2006 version, and that garments labeled to meet the 2011 standard are also in compliance with MUTCD requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has released a summary of the key discussion points made during an informal stakeholder meeting that was held to gather information on the best practices for noise reduction in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The meeting, which was held November 3, 2011, included discussions on personal protective equipment, hearing conservation programs, and engineering controls.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The stakeholders agreed that it is a best practice to provide workers with a variety of hearing protectors. Offering different choices makes it more likely that a worker will wear the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; due to varying personal comfort levels.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If employers make a strong effort to reduce noise through noise controls, they said, it should provide incentive for workers to wear hearing protection.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Stakeholders also discussed the disciplinary measures against employees for failing to wear &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; or other safety products, and decided that it may actually deter workers from wearing such products. It was noted that failure to comply with employer created hearing conservation programs may be the result of hearing protection devices interfering with speech and alarm detection for workers. This dangerous interference may be especially true for many older workers that already have hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The stakeholders suggested that employers develop a rule, communicate the rule to workers through training, audit the program at different levels, and proactively resolve problems when identified.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Northern Safety, a leading distributor of personal protective equipment and safety supplies, recently unveiled a new search system that will greatly enhance the way you browse, find, and select the exact safety products you need.&amp;nbsp;The new features allow the use of refinements to drill down in search results to individual products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new search system allows you to quickly find exactly what you&amp;#39;re looking for on the first try. Browsing through all product information, you will see results in a much higher relevance while searching, compared to searching only designated keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The addition of auto-complete offers suggestions to search for by completing phrases typed into the search bar. For example, if you type in &amp;quot;hard hat,&amp;quot; you will see other popular searches in a list, such as &amp;quot;bullard hard hat&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;full brim hard hat.&amp;quot; The new &amp;quot;did you mean?&amp;quot; feature boosts accuracy of results by automatically redirecting searches with common misspellings or non exact terms.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Searches can be refined more than ever by narrowing search results and selecting various characteristics of products, such as color, price, brand, category, size, material, and many more details.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By introducing the new search system, Northern Safety has shown its commitment to providing a hassle-free safety product purchasing experience. These additions help guide you to products you&amp;#39;re looking for faster and easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized two facilities of the Department of Defense (DoD) with the Energy Star Combined Heat and Power (CHP) award.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The honor was presented to the facilities for their achievement in taking an efficient, clean, and reliable approach to deriving thermal energy and power from one source. By implementing CHP technology, the award winners showed leadership and devotion to the protection of the environment and people&amp;#39;s health, while saving an estimated $6.8 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I congratulate these military bases for leading by example in the efforts to reduce pollution, improve energy efficiency, and cut energy costs,&amp;rdquo; said Gina McCarthy, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Air and Radiation. &amp;ldquo;These advanced CHP systems give us reliable, clean and cost cutting ways to keep our military bases powered and our environment protected.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The EPA&amp;#39;s award is demonstrative of the focus the U.S. is placing on green initiatives. As more begin to unfold, employers will need to help ensure the safety of workers in green jobs by providing them with the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 8, 2012, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood visited Sacramento, California, to promote President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s vision for a high-speed rail in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;LaHood discussed with suppliers how they can maximize the economic impact of almost $800 million in American-made next generation trains that will be purchased or built this year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;California&amp;rsquo;s investments in high-speed rail are creating jobs for American workers today and building a strong foundation for California&amp;rsquo;s economic future,&amp;quot; said Secretary LaHood. &amp;quot;This is exactly what President Obama was talking about when he laid out his blueprint for an economy that&amp;rsquo;s built to last.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Building the rail line would mean a number of new jobs in the construction and manufacturing industries. By the second half of 2012, the California High-Speed Rail Authority hopes to begin construction on the first 130-mile stretch of rail in the state&amp;#39;s Central Valley. The first phase will cost about $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To protect workers from the hazards present in the manufacturing of rail supplies and in the construction of the high-speed rail, provide them with the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and follow standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Although some items were financially cut, the budget proposal for fiscal year 2013 that was presented to Congress on February 13, 2012, includes millions of dollars to improve the health and safety of U.S. workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proposed budget includes $16.9 million that will be used to reduce a large case backlog at the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (FMSHRC). The Department of Labor (DOL), which submitted the budget,&amp;nbsp;requested a total of $12 billion in discretionary funding to run programs including education and employment efforts that help veterans transition into civilian jobs, and job retention and training programs for the unemployed, disadvantaged youths, vulnerable communities, and dislocated workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Labor Department&amp;#39;s fiscal year 2013 budget request reflects our commitment to supporting an American economy that&amp;#39;s built to last,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;Our budget request focuses on programs that will help keep America&amp;#39;s workforce strong and innovative, while providing needed worker protections.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more Americans complete these programs and enter the workforce, training and the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; will help ensure their health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 13, 2012, the Obama Administration released a proposed budget of $8.344 billion for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which will be used to continue to ensure environmental and human health protections.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This budget is focused on fulfilling EPA&amp;rsquo;s core mission to protect health and the environment for millions of American families,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. &amp;quot;It demonstrates fiscal responsibility, while still supporting clean air, healthy waters, and innovative safeguards that are essential to an America built to last.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proposal includes $755 million in funding for the Superfund Cleanup initiative, which was developed to support cleanup efforts at hazardous waste sites that address emergencies at some of the nation&amp;#39;s most highly prioritized cleanup sites.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The budget also provides $576 million to continue research and innovation in areas such as hydraulic fracturing, potential endocrine disruptors, and green infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hazardous waste cleanup can potentially put response workers in danger. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has several standards regarding the issue, which require all workers wear &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; that can include respiratory protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and protective clothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new study, released by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), found that fallout from the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant in Japan resulted in trace amounts in precipitation in the U.S. in about 20 percent of 167 sites analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), and found levels were similar to those taken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the days and weeks after the incident. Many sites studied were far from urban areas, giving a better representation of the American landscape as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Japan&amp;#39;s unfortunate nuclear nightmare provides a rare opportunity for U.S. scientists to test an infrequently needed national capability for detecting and monitoring nuclear fallout over a wide network,&amp;quot; explained USGS director Marcia McNutt. &amp;quot;Had this been a national incident, NADP would have revealed the spatial and temporal patterns of radioactive contamination in order to help protect people and the environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), radiation exposure can pose considerable health risks to workers. Prevent the risk of radiation exposure by using the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as turn-out gear, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and other personal protective equipment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 21, 2012, Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced that 142 small businesses from around the country have begun work on new research projects that will increase the use of green energy, such as better wind turbines, chemical-free ways to kill bacteria in power plant cooling water, and improving gas turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy (DOE) is providing grants totaling $26.4 million to the small businesses, which it says will create jobs and new projects in America and boost the country&amp;#39;s global competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These small businesses are working to develop new technologies to bring to the marketplace, creating new jobs and potentially new industries here in America,&amp;quot; said Secretary Chu.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;As part of the Obama Administration&amp;rsquo;s Startup America Initiative, these innovative small businesses are helping the Department improve America&amp;rsquo;s energy security, grow our economy, and ensure U.S. companies can compete in the global economy.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The development of more green projects, such as wind turbine installations, will likely come with more exposure to green job hazards. Falls, confined spaces, electrical, fire and other similar hazards may be present in these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ensure worker safety by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, electric-shock resistant &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, to employees.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers in New York expanded in February at the quickest speed since June 2010, indicating the industry is putting more Americans to work in factories, and manufacturing is continuing to lead the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed manufacturing in New York State rose for the third consecutive month, rising six points to 19.5, the highest level in more than a year. Other readings from the index show continued expansion in shipments and employment growth, and generally more plans for capital spending.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In their 2012 spending plans, 46 percent of manufacturers say they plan to spend more than they did in 2011, while only 25 percent say they plan to spend less. Likely expenses will include structures, computers, related hardware, and software.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Because the index typically moves parallel with manufacturing employment, manufacturing jobs are also on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more Americans find work in factories, employers will need to ensure they are following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) regulations on the use of appropriate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;During President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s State of the Union address, he announced that &amp;quot;millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration&amp;quot; had been opened, and included a directive to his administration &amp;quot;to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Obama stated that American oil production is at its highest level in eight years, and that last year, America relied less on foreign oil than it had in any of the last 16 years. Still, he noted, America has only 2 percent of the world&amp;#39;s oil reserves, and&amp;nbsp;needs to create a strategy to develop every source of American energy available.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With a supply of natural gas that could last America nearly 100 years, Obama stated his administration will &amp;quot;take every possible action&amp;quot; to ensure these resources are not only developed, but developed safely. Experts believe more than 600,000 jobs for Americans could be created in the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) states that the oil and gas extraction sector has an annual fatality rate of 30 per 100,000 workers, about eight times greater than the rate for all U.S. workers.&amp;nbsp;With so many potential jobs in the industry, provide appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; to help keep workers safe.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A milestone agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments will allow 1.5 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to be opened for oil and gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed the agreement alongside Mexican officials, providing clarity on development of transboundary resources in the Gulf. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) estimates the region holds some 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Obama administration is committed to the responsible expansion of domestic energy production,&amp;quot; Salazar said in a statement. &amp;quot;This agreement makes available promising areas in the resource-rich Gulf of Mexico and establishes a clear process by which both governments can provide the necessary oversight to ensure exploration and development activities are conducted safely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agreement ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations with joint inspection teams from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and the Mexican government. Plans will be reviewed and additional requirements could be set before development can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more exploration and drilling projects begin in the Gulf, workers will need industry-specific &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, as well as general industry products like &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released the final health assessment for tetrachloroethylene (perc) to its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Perc is most often used in the dry cleaning industry, but is also often found in the cleaning of metal machinery and can be used by factory workers to manufacture consumer goods and other chemicals. The assessment confirms what has long been thought - that perc is a &amp;quot;likely human carcinogen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The perc health assessment released today will provide valuable information to help protect people and communities from exposure to perc in soil, water and air,&amp;quot; said Paul Anastas, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Research and Development, in a statement on February 10, 2012. &amp;quot;This assessment emphasizes the value of the IRIS database in providing strong science to support government officials as they make decisions to protect the health of the American people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The health assessment includes information on the cancerous effects of perc for the first time and replaces the 1988 IRIS assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires workers who may be exposed to perc&amp;nbsp;be equipped with the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the risk of its adverse health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Personal protective equipment, including aprons, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and goggles should be worn, while respirators with organic vapors cartridges must be used when elevated perc exposures are anticipated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, February 16, 2012, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Ray LaHood announced the first-ever federally proposed guidelines to urge car makers to design vehicles with the risk of distraction from electronic devices in mind. The move could prevent the installation of &amp;quot;excessively distracting devices&amp;quot; and enhance safety for drivers, pedestrians, and roadway workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines would be voluntary, and would apply to communications, entertainment, information gathering, and navigation devices that are not required to safely operate a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Written by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) division of the DOT, the guidelines would create specific recommended criteria for electronic devices that are installed in vehicles and require drivers to visually or manually operate them.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Distracted driving is a dangerous and deadly habit on America&amp;rsquo;s roadways &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a priority to encourage people to stay focused behind the wheel,&amp;quot; said Secretary LaHood. &amp;quot;These guidelines are a major step forward in identifying real solutions to tackle the issue of distracted driving for drivers of all ages.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After performing extensive studies, NSHTA says it considers some tasks performed by drivers to be unsafe and should be locked out when the car is in motion. The list of &amp;quot;per se&amp;quot; lockouts includes displaying photographic moving visual images that are not related to driving, automatically scrolling text, manually entering information, and reading more than 30 characters of visually presented text.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The guidance was proposed to keep roadways safe for all, including highway workers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drivers encounter many distractions while in highway work zones, such as signs, barrels, and abrupt lane changes. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that crashes in work zones led to the death of 103 workers in 2010.&amp;nbsp;Highway workers can reduce the risk of injury or death by wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Traffic-Safety-Vests" target="_blank"&gt;high-visibility safety vests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 23, 2012, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), working with the National Hearing Conservation Association, announced the winners of the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Colgate-Palmolive, 3M&amp;#39;s Hutchinson Plant, and Bechtel National, Inc. were honored for their dedication to the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss through successful occupational hearing loss prevention practices. The awards were given out on February 24, 2012 at the Annual Hearing Conservation Conference in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Since noise is everywhere, preventing its negative effects requires the integration of occupational safety and health protection with health promotion,&amp;quot; said NIOSH Director Dr. John Howard. &amp;quot;NIOSH supports this concept, also called Total Worker Health, as the most effective approach to promote health. To effectively maintain healthy hearing, it is important for us to extend preventive initiatives outside the workplace, and this year&amp;rsquo;s recipients offer us compelling examples of this approach.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NIOSH estimates that between 5 and 30 million workers in the U.S. experience noise levels at work that put them at risk of hearing loss, with an another 9 million that may be at risk through exposure to chemicals that damage hearing. Help protect workers&amp;#39; hearing by using hearing-related &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and ear muffs, and implementing hearing loss prevention programs in your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a warning, stating that occupational exposure in the refinishing industry to products containing methylene chloride can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alert was issued based on an investigation into the death of a bathtub refinisher, conducted by the Michigan Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation program. The program found two earlier, similar fatalities and notified the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which in turn notified the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA identified 10 additional deaths throughout nine states and noted 10 different products have been associated with the deaths of 13 bathtub refinishers.&amp;nbsp;The products included paint and varnish removers, finish strippers, and aircraft and marine paint removers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Each death occurred in a residential bathroom with inadequate ventilation. Protective equipment, including a respirator, either was not used or was inadequate to protect against methylene chloride vapor, which has been recognized as potentially fatal to furniture strippers and factory workers but has not been reported previously as a cause of death among bathtub refinishers,&amp;quot; the CDC warning read.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to paint stripping and removing, methylene chloride is used in electronics manufacturing and in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, drugs, and film coatings. The extreme hazard the use of methylene chloride poses should be communicated clearly by manufacturers, worker safety agencies, trade organizations, and public health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alert concluded that employers &amp;quot;should strongly consider&amp;quot; alternative methods of bathtub refinishing, and always ensure worker safety protections to reduce the risk of health hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, methylene chloride poses serious risks, and workers must wear appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; when working near the chemical. Respiratory protection, protective clothing, and equipment can help keep workers operating near the chemical safe.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On February 15, 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced a six-month extension for its temporary enforcement measures in residential construction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The measures have been extended through September 15, 2012. During this time, OSHA will continue to place a high priority on compliance assistance for residential &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, including increased outreach and penalty reductions to help employers understand and comply with the new standards. OSHA Compliance Assistance Specialists (CASs) are responding promptly to requests for on-site assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The extension of the temporary measures also includes abatement extension dates and consistency measures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Over the past year, OSHA has worked closely with the industry, conducting over 1,000 outreach sessions nationwide to assist employers in complying with the new directive,&amp;quot; OSHA said in a statement. &amp;quot;OSHA will continue to work with employers to ensure a clear understanding of, and to facilitate compliance with, the new policy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA provides several resources that help employers ensure compliance. Easy-to-read fact sheets, PowerPoint presentations, and other materials written specifically for fall protection in residential construction are readily available at &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/doc/topics/residentialprotection/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s Fall Protection in Residential Construction&lt;/a&gt; page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On Monday, February 13, 2012, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation had been given a budget of $74 billion, which will be used to create the framework for economic growth and competitiveness through infrastructure network investments, enhanced safety, and a modernized transportation system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Obama&amp;rsquo;s budget for the Department of Transportation reflects our commitment to investing in an America that is built to last,&amp;quot; said LaHood.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;A strong American economy depends on the roadways, runways, and railways that move people and goods from coast to coast and around the globe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the fiscal 2013 budget is a six-year $476 billion project that aims to improve highways and transit networks across the country, working to ensure the safety of travelers and providing them with more options for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With these funds, many new roadway construction and maintenance projects will begin, increasing the chances for injuries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a preliminary total shows 103 fatalities in work zones occurred in 2010. That year, transportation incidents accounted for 72 percent of roadway work zone fatal occupational injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Roadway workers can help prevent injuries by wearing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which include high-visibility vests, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In the first report of its kind, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated the potential undiscovered, technically recoverable shale oil and gas found in the lands of Alaska&amp;#39;s North Slope.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The estimates range from zero to 2 billion barrels of oil and from zero to 80 trillion cubic feet of gas. The resources are said to be technically recoverable, suggesting current technology and industry practices are sufficient for extraction. The area has not yet been tapped for its oil and gas due to economic and infrastructure issues, and lies far from the environmentally sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Better knowledge of the untapped resource potential found in all areas of the country will help us better make science-based decisions about how we continue to grow domestic energy production for America,&amp;quot; said Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. &amp;quot;Alaska&amp;rsquo;s energy resources hold great promise and economic opportunity for the American people, and we will continue to expand our scientific understanding of existing resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Protect workers from inherent hazards in oil and gas well drilling by ensuring the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has created a new local emphasis program to protect workers from hazards found on dairy farms throughout Wisconsin, including risks related to manure storage, lack of vehicle roll-over protection, machine-guarding, and animal handling.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Far too many workers are injured and killed in preventable incidents at dairy farms in Wisconsin,&amp;quot; said Mark Hysell, OSHA&amp;#39;s area director in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. &amp;quot;This program will enable OSHA inspectors to visit dairy farms and ensure that all required measures are taken to protect workers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s local emphasis programs can be found throughout the country, and seek to address hazards that pose a particular risk to workers in a certain area. The measures developed for the Wisconsin outreach program can also be applied to farming and agricultural operations nationwide, as the agricultural industry ranks among the most dangerous in the U.S., according to OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Every day, roughly 243 agricultural workers suffer a serious lost-worktime injury. Prevent such accidents by wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; in grain storage bins, or &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; when working near farm equipment and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of FluMist Quadrivalent, a vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza in people between the ages of 2 and 49, making it the first approved flu vaccine to contain four strains of the virus - two influenza A strains and two influenza B strains.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This vaccine, like the previously approved FluMist Trivalent, contains weakened virus strains and is administered as a nasal spray. The vaccine protects against the two forms of the flu virus, and while the earlier-approved FluMist (trivalent) also contained strains from both forms, the inclusion of a second B strain increases the likelihood of strong protection from circulating influenza B strains.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Illness caused by Influenza B virus affects children, particularly young and school-aged, more than any other population,&amp;quot; said Karen Midthun, M.D., director of the FDA&amp;rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. &amp;quot;A vaccine containing the four virus strains most likely to spread and cause illness during the influenza season offers an additional option to aid in influenza prevention efforts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Encourage workers to protect themselves and co-workers from the flu virus by providing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1&amp;q1=Janitorial&amp;q2=Hygiene+and+Restroom+Supplies&amp;q3=Hand+Cleaners%2C+Lotions%2C+and+Dispensers&amp;x1=category-1&amp;x2=category-2&amp;x3=category-3" class="dnautolink"&gt;hand sanitizers&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace, and ensuring &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/industrial/janitorial/janitorial-chemicals-equipment/janitorial-chemicals/disinfectants" target="_blank"&gt;disinfectant and towelettes&lt;/a&gt; are on hand. Coughs and sneezes should always be covered with a tissue or directed into the upper sleeve to keep the spread of the flu virus to a minimum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood recently announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) will provide $16.9 million to 12 cities and states to relocate, replace, and improve railroad tracks as a part of the Federal Railroad Administration&amp;#39;s (FRA&amp;#39;s) Rail Line Relocation and Improvement grant program.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The FRA received more than $67 million in requests for the funds, which are expected to be used to increase safety, livability, and economic development in communities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The overwhelming number of applications we received for this program shows that state and local officials recognize the economic boost that comes with improving transportation infrastructure,&amp;quot; said Secretary LaHood. &amp;ldquo;These investments will help advance President Obama&amp;rsquo;s vision of an &amp;lsquo;America Built to Last&amp;rsquo; by putting people back to work on transportation projects while creating livable communities and stimulating economic growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that construction activities, which include alteration and repair of bridge erection and other transportation projects, expose workers to serious hazards, such as machinery, heavy construction equipment, and harmful dusts and vapors. Protect employees against these hazards by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, respirators, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) has published a new industry standard to provide workers in cold temperatures with appropriate insulated apparel.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The American National Standard for Classification of Insulating Apparel Used in Cold Work Environments (ANSI/ISEA 201-2012) provides classification for warm apparel based on its ability to keep workers warm in low temperatures and its ability to retain that protection throughout the life of the garment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Garments tested under the new standard will be assessed after a specified number of washing or dry cleaning cycles. Once tested, thermal performance will be displayed on the garment label, as well as its durability classification&amp;nbsp;which shows how many laundering cycles it went through before the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you&amp;rsquo;re operating in extreme cold conditions, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to find apparel that will keep workers comfortable and still allow them to do their jobs,&amp;quot; said ISEA&amp;nbsp;Director of Member and Technical Services Cristine Fargo. &amp;quot;This standard provides an objective way to measure and show insulating performance, and gives users an important tool for selecting the right garment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Cold work environments can effect construction workers, linemen, emergency responders, transport workers, refrigerated warehouse, meat packaging and storage workers, and others. Prevent injuries in cold temperatures by providing workers with insulated or thermal &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, footwear, face masks, and clothing designed specifically for cold environments.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Staying hydrated can help keep workers in construction, manufacturing, and other industries productive. Northern Safety offers the Gatorade&amp;reg; 2 1/2 Gallon Instant Powder Mix Variety Pack to reduce workplace dehydration and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/28814/Gatorade-2-1-2-Gallon-Instant-Powder-Mix-Variety-Pack-32-Case" target="_blank"&gt;Gatorade&amp;reg; 2 1/2 Gallon Instant Powder Mix Variety Pack&lt;/a&gt; includes 32 low-sodium Gatorade&amp;reg; packets featuring electrolytes that help employees battle dehydration. Employees need only mix a packet with 2 1/2 gallons of water for a quick, tasty drink that quenches any thirst. Flavors including fruit punch, grape-riptide rush, lemon-lime, and orange can help satisfy and rehydrate any hard-working employee.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Providing workers Gatorade&amp;reg; may help reduce the incidence of workplace injuries. Water represents at least half of a person&amp;#39;s body weight, and dehydration can lead to heat stress. As a result, workplace productivity and safety can suffer. Offer employees the variety pack at locations where fresh water is available, or provide mixes beforehand where water is unavailable. It&amp;#39;s easy to help workers avoid dehydration with a delicious beverage they can enjoy throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Maintain a healthy workplace with the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1&amp;amp;q1=First+Aid&amp;amp;q2=Heat+Stress+Relief&amp;amp;x1=category-1&amp;amp;x2=category-2"&gt;heat stress relief&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;your workers need for hydration, energy, and safety - Gatorade&amp;reg; 2 1/2 Gallon Instant Powder Mix Variety Pack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;After finishing an exceptionally dry winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says that no area of the country faces a high risk of major to record setting floods this spring, the first time such a forecast has been issued in four years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency&amp;#39;s annual Spring Outlook 2012 provides a forecast for flooding around the country from April to June.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;rsquo;re not forecasting a repeat of recent historic and prolonged flooding in the central and northern U.S., and that is a relief,&amp;quot; said Laura Furgione, deputy director, NOAA&amp;rsquo;s National Weather Service. &amp;quot;The severity of any flooding this year will be driven by rainfall more so than the melting of the current snowpack.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The only areas of the country with above-average risk of flooding include the Ohio River basin states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, as well as some parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. NOAA added that this area is also expected to see above average April rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To protect your workplace in the event of a flood, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides flood preparedness and cleanup guidelines. Ensure workers adhere to OSHA standards, which include the use of protective clothing,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, rubber boots and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is in the process of developing a voluntary and secure electronic occupational safety and health monitoring system that will keep tabs on workplace data.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The original version of the Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN) was intended for the healthcare sector, but the new version will expand the program to other sectors. OHSN will aid in surveillance for U.S. workplaces, and will be used to analyze and report workplace data to document occupational injury and illness events.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to NIOSH, participants will benefit from the program by gaining the ability to gauge a workplace&amp;#39;s internal injury and illness rates and trends to prevent later, similar events.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With the new surveillance measures in place, employers will have an effective method of analyzing risk factors and the circumstances that cause injuries. The OHSN will help to assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts including the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) have renewed their alliance to promote best practices for keeping worker exposure to health and physical hazards to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The renewed alliance will address motor vehicle safety and awareness of occupational health and safety for employees in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our most recent Alliance with the American Society of Safety Engineers has focused on preventing falls, sprains and strains in construction, distracted driving, and hazards in shipyard employment,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health David Michaels. &amp;quot;Our continued Alliance with ASSE will help ensure that workers are aware of on-the-job hazards and help reduce occupational illnesses and injuries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s Alliance Program works with unions, consulates, trade or professional organizations, among others to increase workplace safety. The renewed ASSE Alliance will focus on protecting workers from on the job hazards and injuries. Equip employees with the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to help reduce the chance of fatalities, injuries, and illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Many cities, towns, and businesses use stanchions to keep pedestrians safe as they walk near hazardous areas. Safety equipment like Plastic Chain for Crowd Control Stanchions helps to guide workers and others away from possible dangers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Product/17857/Plastic-Chain-for-Crowd-Control-Stanchions" target="_blank"&gt;Plastic Chain for Crowd Control Stanchions&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to direct crowds of any size. Companies can use the chains to mark crowd, traffic, and equipment barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bright colors maximize visibility to control large groups and manage foot traffic in any area,&amp;nbsp;including limiting access to displays, setting up a border, creating lines for crowd flow in arenas, and separating recently cleaned areas that have wet floors.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s lightweight, portable design offers flexibility by allowing workers to carry the chain to different locations and it&amp;#39;s rust, fade, and weather resistant for indoor and outdoor use.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On March 22, 2012, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa P. Jackson testified before the U.S. Senate and Committee on Environment and Public Works, where she discussed the EPA&amp;#39;s $8.344 billion budget request and the agency&amp;#39;s commitment to protecting the environment and the safety of its workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Jackson stated that the budget request was a testament to the EPA&amp;#39;s commitment to supporting clean air, clean water, and innovative safeguards that are crucial for America.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This budget recognizes the importance of our partners at the state, local and tribal level. As you know, they are at the front lines of implementing our environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act,&amp;quot; she stated. &amp;quot;In fact, the largest portion - 40 percent of EPA&amp;#39;s funding request - is directed to the state and tribal assistance grants appropriation to support their efforts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The EPA&amp;#39;s budget also reflects how important it is to clean up contaminated sites by including a request for $755 million to continue support of the Superfund cleanup programs and to maintain emergency preparedness and response capabilities. Ensure workers are protected from hazardous waste dangers by using appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as respiratory protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and other protective clothing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has revised its Hazard Communication Standard in order to better protect workers from hazardous chemicals, aligning the standards with the United Nations&amp;#39; global chemical labeling system.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Once the new standard is implemented, it is expected to prevent an estimated 43 deaths and result in up to $475.2 million in increased U.S. business productivity every year.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exposure to hazardous chemicals is one of the most serious dangers facing American workers today,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;Revising OSHA&amp;#39;s Hazard Communication Standard will improve the quality, consistency, and clarity of hazard information that workers receive, making it safer for workers to do their jobs and easier for employers to stay competitive in the global marketplace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The standard will be fully implemented in 2016, and will benefit workers by clarifying what chemical hazards exist in the workplace, promoting safety training, and improving understanding of hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, hazardous chemicals in the workplace can include dusts, mixtures, and common items such as paints, fuels, and solvents. Protect workers from these hazards with appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Signs+and+Shipping+Supplies;q2=Signs;q3=Chemicals+and+Hazardous+Materials+Signage;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;chemical and hazardous material signs&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory protection, and protective clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The revised version of the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), which was announced in mid-March by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), will use nine new pictograms that show what health, physical and environmental hazards are present.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Each pictogram is determined by the chemical hazard classification. The Health Hazard pictogram will be placed on items that may be a carcinogen, a respiratory sensitizer, or pose an aspiration toxicity threat. The Exclamation Mark pictogram will be used to warn workers of skin and eye irritants and respiratory tract irritants, among other toxic effects. Flame pictograms will warn workers of any flammable or self-heating products, as well as those that emit flammable gas.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The final HCS labels eight of the nine &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/Publications/HazComm_QuickCard_Pictogram.html" target="_blank"&gt;pictograms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as mandatory, with the exception of the non-mandatory environmental pictogram, as environmental hazards are not inside OSHA&amp;#39;s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ensure workers understand the hazards depicted by each pictogram, and provide appropriate training and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; to protect them from chemical hazards. &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;Safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and protective clothing can be used to protect workers from chemical hazards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new report written by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) states that research conducted by the federally funded agency has helped to reduce commercial fishing industry fatalities by 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NIOSH first started working to improve conditions in Alaska in 1990, as commercial fishing had long held the title of the deadliest occupation. Workers are continually threatened by environmental conditions, slip and trip hazards, injuries due to contact from gear entanglement, and falls overboard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The research shows from 2000 to 2010 the fatality rate for fishers was 124 per 100,000, compared to 4 per 100,000 for all other occupations. The two leading causes of death are vessel disasters and falling overboard. To improve safety, NIOSH began by focusing on industry-specific hazards and expanded its research to specific regional hazards for the rest of the country&amp;nbsp;to be included in a new Commercial Fishing Incident Database.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This research was later used by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during the Fishing Vessel Safety Forum, which cited the research during the event, to improve safety in the commercial fishing industry. Ensure your crew wears &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Traffic+Safety+Supplies;q3=Traffic+Safety+Water+Flotation;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;personal flotation devices&lt;/a&gt; (PFDs) to help protect them from commercial fishing hazards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Fatal work injuries involving falls dropped 2 percent to 635 in 2010, compared to 645 in 2009, and have dropped 25 percent from a high of 847 fatal falls in 2007, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since 2007, fatal falls within the private construction industry have dropped by 42 percent and fatal injuries caused by a collision between a worker and object or heavy equipment went down 4 percent in 2010 to 402.&amp;nbsp;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says the first step to lowering the risk of falls is to identify all hazards and develop a plan to proect workers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, falls are one of the leading causes of traumatic occupational death, and make up 8 percent of all occupational fatalities that occur from trauma. The agency states that whenever construction workers are operating at a height of six feet, general industry workers are at four feet, or maritime workers are at five feet or higher, they are at risk and need to be protected. Ensure employee safety by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; appropriate for the specific worksite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is seeking comments on the best ways to prevent injuries and fatalities during concrete reinforcement activities within the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The agency is also requesting comments concerning how to keep vehicles from backing into workers in construction, agriculture, maritime, and general industries. OSHA says it will use the comments it receives to learn more about the ways in which workers are injured in these settings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the concrete industry, workers must use reinforcing methods to keep the integrity of the concrete in tact. These workers are confronted by several life-threatening hazards during these activities, including impalement, collapsed walls, and slips, trips, and falls. In the period from 2000 to 2009, OSHA statistics show more than 30 people were killed during concrete reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employers have also noted workers face fatal injuries when struck by vehicles backing up, and have also been crushed after being pinned between objects and machinery. Between 2005 and 2010, about 360 workers were killed in backover incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Protect workers from these hazards by providing thorough job training and the appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Traffic+Safety+Supplies;q3=Traffic+Safety+Vests%2C+T+Shirts%2C+and+Sweatshirts;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;high-visibility garments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and rebar protective caps.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced on March 16, 2012 that a new report indicates a large gap between the amount of spending being done on transportation infrastructure and the estimated levels of expenditures needed to keep the nation&amp;#39;s highway and transit systems maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Obama is committed to building the transportation infrastructure we need for tomorrow by putting people to work today,&amp;quot; said Secretary LaHood. &amp;quot;This report shows how important it is important to get started now rebuilding America&amp;rsquo;s roads, bridges, and transit systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The report, titled &amp;quot;2010 Status of the Nation&amp;rsquo;s Highways, Bridges and Transit: Conditions and Performance,&amp;quot; projects that $101 billion, not accounting for inflation, will be needed every year for the next 20 years to keep highway infrastructure at its current state. The report notes that in 2008, all levels of government spent a total of $91 billion on highway improvements, a 48.4 percent jump compared to 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The need to upgrade and maintain the nation&amp;#39;s highways and bridges means more highway work zone projects across the country. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 103 work zone fatalities in 2010, while transportation incidents accounted for 72 percent of roadway work zone occupational injuries that year. Lower workers&amp;#39; risk of injuries or death by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?q=high+visibility+vest" target="_blank"&gt;high-visibility vests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on March 27, 2012, that it had proposed the first Clean Air Act standard for Carbon Pollution from new power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The proposed standard indicates the trend toward building cleaner power generation facilities that use American-made technologies, such as clean-burning natural gas generation. The new standard would also encourage new technologies to be deployed at facilities yet to be built that would burn coal while emitting less carbon pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today we&amp;rsquo;re taking a common-sense step to reduce pollution in our air, protect the planet for our children, and move us into a new era of American energy,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. &amp;quot;Right now there are no limits to the amount of carbon pollution that future power plants will be able to put into our skies...We&amp;rsquo;re putting in place a standard that relies on the use of clean, American made technology to tackle a challenge that we can&amp;rsquo;t leave to our kids and grandkids.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), green jobs pose many of the same hazards that are commonly known in workplaces, including falls from heights and falling objects. Protect workers on green projects by using approved &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has released a statement urging all recovery workers, employers, and the public to use extreme caution during recovery efforts following the damaging tornadoes that struck the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas area on April 3, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA is providing on-site compliance assistance to recovery workers and volunteers to ensure they are aware of the hazards they may encounter, and the necessary steps they should take to remain safe and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our main concern is the safety of the workers conducting cleanup activities. Our Dallas and Fort Worth compliance assistance staff are on the ground in affected areas providing assistance,&amp;quot; said John Hermanson, OSHA&amp;#39;s regional administrator in Dallas. &amp;quot;Workers are exposed to a wide array of hazards during storm recovery efforts that can be minimized by knowledge, safe work practices, and the use of personal protective equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hazards include downed electrical wires, carbon monoxide poisoning, fall and struck-by dangers from tree trimming or working at heights, burns, lacerations, and exposure to dangerous materials and heavy equipment. Protect workers from these hazards by supplying appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and respiratory protection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;At Safety 2012, which will be held June 3-5 in Denver, Colorado, participants including safety, health, and environmental professionals working across all industries&amp;nbsp;will learn about the latest advancements in personal protective equipment and the challenges posed by supplying safety products on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The conference will include how &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; are used for activities involving high heat, molten metal, and hot liquid in chemical and petrochemical environments. Also, participants will learn about the challenges associated with supplying safety products internationally. Often, these hardships are identified in hindsight through trial and error - a method that can come with fines, worker injuries, and fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Presentations will be given by some of the leading minds in the safety, health, and environmental&amp;nbsp;industries, and will come in the form of lectures, case studies, and small group discussions. These presentations will help employers develop solutions to challenges faced in a wide variety of workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires the use of safety products to reduce employee exposure to dangerous hazards. Employers are responsible for providing the appropriate safety products to protect their workers. Ensure worker safety by supplying these products, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) has released a new version of a compilation of safety videos entitled &amp;quot;Safety Videos Volume 2,&amp;quot; which details various accidents in chemical research plants, including dust fires and explosions, that have occurred around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In total, the CSB has released 28 safety videos that are all based on actual findings from CSB investigations, determinations of root causes, and safety recommendations. The CSB produces the videos in order to present CSB investigation findings in a simple and compelling format that encourages viewers to take action in their own workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The CSB&amp;rsquo;s safety video program has served as a highly successful way to communicate the root causes and findings resulting from the CSB&amp;rsquo;s accident investigations; across industries and continents, demand for CSB safety videos is global,&amp;quot; said CSB chairman Rafarl Moure-Eraso.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The videos have won several awards, including three Peer Awards given by the Television, Internet, and Video Association of Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp;The video program was cited when the CSB was named recipient of the American Chemical Society&amp;#39;s Howard Fawcett Award. This award honors outstanding contributions to members in the chemical health and safety field. It was the first time the award had been presented to a whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Protect workers from chemical reactivity hazards, such as toxic fumes, fires, and explosions, by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; designed to mitigate these risks, including respiratory equipment, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) Directorate of Training and Education (DTE) was recently reaccredited by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET) to keep providing Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for occupational injury and illness prevention training.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;DTE includes the OSHA Training Institute, and offers a broad range of courses and programs designed to help workers and employers expand their knowledge of how to recognize, avoid, and prevent workplace safety and health hazards. In addition, OSHA offers educational resources to help companies train their workers and comply with U.S. regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OSHA education programs train over 850,000 federal and state compliance officers, state consultants, federal employees, employers, and workers each year,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health David Michaels. &amp;quot;Our training, in critical job-related skills, ensures that our compliance officers, workers, and employers stay on the cutting edge to prevent worker injuries, illnesses and deaths. Our IACET reaccreditation demonstrates OSHA&amp;#39;s commitment to lifelong learning and high standards for all of our education and training programs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Ensure worksites are OSHA-compliant by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to required training.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In late March, 2012, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) announced a major milestone had been achieved for the global green building market when the number of LEED-certified&amp;nbsp;commercial building projects hit the 12,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Since being launched in 2000, the LEED green building program has revolutionized the way built or man-made environments are designed, developed, operated, and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Twelve years after the first 12 projects earned LEED certification, the green building community has reached a significant milestone,&amp;quot; said Rick Fedrizzi, president and CEO of USGBC. &amp;quot;The momentum for green buildings is rippling around the globe, enhancing the built environment for generations to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Fedrizzi added that the accomplishment was even more relevant as the project is beginning while the final comments are being collected for LEED 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With these next changes, LEED will continue in its role as a catalyst for transformation of the built environment to ever higher standards of sustainable practice,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Green jobs provide many new opportunities for U.S. workers, but they also come with risks and hazards. Protect workers from electric shock, falls from heights, and machinery by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Obama Administration and governors of the Great Lakes States announced they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enhance the coordination and speed of review for potential offshore wind projects.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On March 30, 2012, President Barack Obama and the governors of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania signed the agreement to streamline development of wind turbines in the Great Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Obama is focused on leveraging American energy sources,&amp;quot; said Nancy Sutley, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. &amp;quot;This agreement among Federal agencies and Great Lakes states is a smart, practical way to encourage the development of homegrown energy that will create jobs, power homes, and help increase our nation&amp;rsquo;s energy security.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The MOU will increase collaboration between federal and state agencies to create an action plan to set priorities and identify steps for achieving efficient and responsible evaluation of potential wind power projects in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has identified several hazards found in the wind energy industry and controls to keep workers safe. These include falls, confined spaces, lockout/tagout, medical and first aid, and machine guarding. Keep workers safe by implementing workplace hazard controls and providing the appropriate OSHA-mandated &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced on April 9, 2012, that a final locomotive safety rule had been cleared that eliminates unnecessary regulatory burdens, increases the use of new technologies and merges current industry and engineering best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safety is our top priority,&amp;quot; said LaHood. &amp;quot;This rule will help improve safety and working conditions while also providing significant regulatory relief to the railroad industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The final rule will bring the Federal Railroad Administration&amp;#39;s (FRA&amp;#39;s) safety regulatory program for locomotive operations up to date by merging a number of regulations and addressing technological advancements. Certain aspects of the current rule had not been updated in the last 30 years - a period in which technology, industry, and best practices continued to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new rule addresses the design, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, repair, and record-keeping for locomotive mechanical and electrical components, and also touches on safety appliances and control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers in train yards are exposed to a number of hazards, including proximity to large, moving parts and heavy machinery. Protect railroad workers from these hazards by providing quality &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and high-visibility safety vests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;One of the most recognizable monuments in all of Washington, D.C., is currently the subject of an in-depth survey to determine if there have been any leveling issues within the National Mall caused by the August 2011 earthquake that hit the eastern seaboard.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A group of experts from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration&amp;#39;s (NOAA&amp;#39;s) National Geodetic Survey (NGS) are currently performing a leveling survey on the Washington Monument to learn what kind of seismic shift, if any, occurred to the ground beneath the monument. Early analyses show there was no significant vertical motion, but even slight variances in topography could affect repair plans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Later this year, NOAA surveyors will use GPS to take measurements from the top of the monument to determine if the structure has tilted at all due to the rare 5.8-magnitude earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Engineering firms that the National Park Service (NPS) has under contract will repair the stone structure. These firms will use the findings of the leveling survey to help complete the planned $15 million restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The engineering and repair crews working to finish the restoration of the monument will need to follow the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), including the use of appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Fire Protection Association&amp;#39;s Firewise Communities Program is offering a new online quiz entitled &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.firewise.org/Information/Firewise-Quiz.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Preparing Your Home for Wildfire Season&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which was designed to help property owners and residents prepare their assets for wildfire season.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The quiz, which consists of 10 questions, was based on Firewise principles and tips the organization has gathered through the years.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With many states now in wildfire season, the Firewise program focuses on simple ways individuals can take responsibility for preparing their own homes now before a wildfire threatens their community,&amp;quot; said Firewise Program Manager Michele Steinberg. &amp;quot;Our quiz offers residents information to share with their neighbors and provides answers to commonly asked questions to help them get started.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Questions on the quiz hit topics on the areas of the home ignition zone, the Firewise Communities/USA Recognition Program, landscape maintenance, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established a number of regulations governing fire prevention, safety, and recovery. Make sure your home, business, and workers are protected from unexpected fires by using fire &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Fire+Safety+Equipment;q3=Fire+Extinguishers;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;fire extinguishers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Fire+Safety+Equipment;q3=Smoke+and+Carbon+Monoxide+Detectors;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;smoke and carbon monoxide detectors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Fire+Safety+Equipment;q3=Fire+Escape+Ladders+and+Hoods;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3"

                &lt;p&gt;The tornado response and recovery efforts currently taking place in Texas are echoing the devastating storms that leveled the town of Joplin, Missouri, in May, 2011 - where the efforts to rebuild are still underway.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In February, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced the 2012 Governor&amp;#39;s Joplin Habitat Challenge in order to attract more volunteers and donations to help the recovery effort. The challenge is to construct 35 new homes in Joplin with the Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity before the end of 2012. Though only a fraction of the 7,700 homes that were damaged or destroyed, the plan marks a commitment to rebuilding the city.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program is supported by a $3.6 million federal Community Development Block Grant, as well as all the state&amp;#39;s professional sports teams, the University of Missouri Tigers, and the Kansas Speedway, which has partnered with NASCAR Unites. The project will divide the 35 planned homes into 7 neighborhoods, with each neighborhood sponsored by one of the seven Missouri athletic organizations. Members and other staff from each of the teams will volunteer their time on several occasions throughout the project to help achieve the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;At the 2012 Joplin High School graduation, President Obama and Governor Nixon are slated to speak on the progress of the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Provide workers and volunteers with protection from recovery operation hazards, such as falling debris and sharp objects, by supplying appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation&amp;#39;s (DOT&amp;#39;s) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has proposed a set of new procedures it hopes will improve excavation damage prevention programs and raise the penalties for violators.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Excavation damage has long been a leading cause of all pipeline failures, and is also recognized as the most severe threat to worker safety, reliability, and integrity of the natural gas distribution network. Between 2002 and 2011, excavation procedures led to more than 25 percent of fatalities involving pipeline failures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Safety is our top priority,&amp;quot; said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. &amp;quot;It is important for states to have strong and effective enforcement programs as we work together to crack down on violators of these important laws.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new rules will bolster states&amp;#39; excavation damage prevention enforcement programs, provide better protection for pipelines, and allow federal enforcement agencies to step in when state agencies may not.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), hazards within the trenching and excavation industry include working near heavy machinery, electrical hazards, manual handling of materials, and working in close proximity to traffic. Protect workers from these hazards by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and high-visibility safety vests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A recent study published in Public Health Reports found that 88 workers under the age of 20 died from work-related injuries in 2010, while another 20,000 suffered an occupational injury or illness that led to time away from work.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study found that much of the time, the injuries and deaths were due to poorly regulated work environments. The report was released by the Colorado School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t tend to think of child labor as a major issue in the U.S., but we should,&amp;quot; said lead study author Dr. Carol Runyan. &amp;quot;Laws governing the employment of youth ages 14 to 17 in this country are often very lenient and in the case of family farms virtually non-existent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Runyan says the results show stricter oversight of working conditions is needed for young employees, including those in the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), young workers may be at a higher risk for injury because of their inexperience at work and their physical, cognitive, emotional, and developmental characteristics. Provide employees, regardless of age, with OSHA-mandated &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced on April 12, 2012, that it will begin accepting applications from nonprofit organizations to be cleared to give standard classroom instruction on occupational safety and health&amp;nbsp;as an OSHA Training Institute Education Center.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The initiative is a part of OSHA&amp;#39;s Training Institute (OTI) Education Centers Program, which serves private sector workers, supervisors, and employers within OSHA&amp;#39;s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The number of requests for occupational safety and health training from private sector and federal agency personnel continues to grow,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;quot;In 2012, OSHA hopes to increase the number of OTI Education Centers capable of offering quality occupational safety and health training.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA started the program in 1992 in response to the growing demand for workplace safety training that was focused on OSHA compliance. Since then, the centers have trained more than 250,000 students.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;OSHA&amp;#39;s training centers provide training that promotes work safety and helps businesses stay in compliance with current standards, including appropriate use of personal protective equipment. Ensure workers are safe from hazards by supplying &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, hearing protection, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Contractors for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Safety and Ecology Corporation (SEC) recently demolished four structures in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the Building 3026 C/D Hot Cells Project.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The demolished building at one time processed radioisotopes, making it a safety concern for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) since the outer structure of the facility was removed in 2010. The demolition completely removed the building&amp;#39;s 3026 C side.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers are preparing two more structures for demolition, which when completed, will bring an end to the project that has been funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The bulk of the waste that has been taken from the site has been shipped away, and workers are now cleaning the foundation for final radiological surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are pleased with the most recent progress on this project, considering it was one of the most pressing risks to the workforce and ongoing research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,&amp;quot; said Sue Cange, acting assistant manager for Environmental Management.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), demolition work involves serious hazards, many of which are similar to the construction industry. Protect demolition workers by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, respiratory protection, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is highlighting its Total Worker Health&amp;trade; (TWH&amp;trade;) initiative&amp;nbsp;to effectively address health promotion and protection in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program was developed as a strategy to integrate occupational safety and health protection into health promotion to ultimately prevent worker injury and illness. It was created in response to the rapidly aging American workforce, which is being hit by epidemic levels of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, arthritis, and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NIOSH believes that the safest and healthiest worker only evolves in an atmosphere where management is fully engaged in the wellbeing of its staff, where the environment is hazard-free and supportive, and where workplace policies and interventions encourage healthier choices,&amp;quot; the Institute noted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Some of the issues relevant to TWH&amp;trade; include, persistent and emerging hazards, health, productivity, and disability management, and promoting a health and wellness culture. NIOSH is finding a strong connection between the work environment and the overall health and safety of workers. The TWH&amp;trade; program intends to identify and support approaches to reduce workplace hazards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To ensure an all-around healthy work environment, tailor programs to the specific workplace and provide employees with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, which include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is soliciting applications under the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program to fund training for workers and employers on how to recognize workplace hazards and control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The training will also help employers and workers understand their rights and obligations. A total of $1.2 million will be available to nonprofit, community and faith-based organizations, colleges and universities, and other employer and worker groups.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Department of Labor is committed to ensuring that workers and employers are fully aware of health and safety hazards, and how they can be prevented,&amp;quot; said Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. &amp;quot;The programs funded by these grants will supply hard-to-reach workers, small businesses, and those in high-hazard industries with the knowledge and tools they need to support safe and healthful workplaces.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Targeted topic training grants, and training and educational materials development grants will be offered through the program. Both types of grants have a one year duration, and support training material and program development to address workplace hazards and prevention strategies for workers and employers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;By providing additional training, OSHA will help workers understand the importance of supplying appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for workers. Ensure employees are working in the safest environment by providing proper&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, which include respiratory protection, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The first case of a human being infected with an influenza A H3N2 variant (H3N2v) virus in 2012 has been reported, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified as a strain very similar to the H3N2v that infected 12 people in the U.S. in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The virus, which was found in a child in the state of Utah, contains genes from human, swine, and avian flu viruses, as well as the M gene from the H1N1 virus that spread in 2009. The CDC is currently performing animal and public health investigations to isolate the origin of the Utah infection, and if other human cases have appeared since.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The virus received its &amp;quot;variant&amp;quot; designation because it&amp;#39;s known to circulate in swine, but not in people. However, once it was identified in a human, it was called a &amp;quot;variant influenza virus.&amp;quot; Including the Utah case, the number of human infections around the country with H3N2v&amp;nbsp;viruses has grown to 21 since July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To keep influenza viruses and other communicable diseases from spreading in the workplace, provide tissues, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1&amp;q1=Janitorial&amp;q2=Hygiene+and+Restroom+Supplies&amp;q3=Hand+Cleaners%2C+Lotions%2C+and+Dispensers&amp;x1=category-1&amp;x2=category-2&amp;x3=category-3" class="dnautolink"&gt;hand sanitizers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Janitorial;q2=Janitorial+Chemicals+and+Equipment;q3=Janitorial+Chemicals;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" class="dnautolink"&gt;disinfectant wipes&lt;/a&gt; for employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new directive from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) gives OSHA representatives a guideline for how to discuss investigation procedures with family members after a workplace fatality has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The guidance was established to ensure OSHA representatives speak with a victim&amp;#39;s family soon after an incident, establish a point of contact, and keep up a working relationship with the family.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OSHA is committed to working with families to explain the circumstances surrounding the deaths of their loved ones,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;quot;This directive ensures that OSHA receives the necessary information from the family to assist in the investigation, and keeps the family informed throughout the investigation and settlement processes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new directive states OSHA representatives will contact the victim&amp;#39;s family to outline the investigation process and timeline, and provide them with updates throughout the investigation process. When the investigation is completed, OSHA will explain the findings and answer any questions the family may have.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The measure is just one way OSHA is working to improve workplace conditions around the country. To help keep your employees safe and prevent occupational injuries and fatalities, provide workers with appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and ensure all required &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is in place.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, hosted a press teleconference on May 7, 2012, where he announced the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA) 2012 Heat Illness Prevention Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The prevention program is a nationwide initiative held to increase awareness and education among workers and their employers about the dangers of working outdoors in hot weather. The program also outlines the steps that must be taken to prevent heat-related illnesses, as every year, heat illness affects thousands of workers, and dozens die from heat stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Agriculture workers; building, road and other construction workers; utility workers; baggage handlers; roofers; landscapers; and others who work outside are all at risk. Drinking plenty of water and taking frequent breaks in cool, shaded areas are incredibly important in the hot summer months,&amp;quot; said Dr. Michaels&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For outdoor workers, &amp;#39;water, rest and shade&amp;#39; are three words that can make the difference between life and death,&amp;quot; Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said. &amp;quot;If employers take reasonable precautions, and look out for their workers, we can beat the heat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To prepare workers and employers for the summer season, OSHA has prepared &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;educational materials&lt;/a&gt; in both English and Spanish on heat illness safety and prevention, and what to do in the event of an emergency. Additionally, OSHA created and released a free &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/heat_app.html" target="_blank"&gt;mobile device app&lt;/a&gt; for Android-based platforms and the iPhone that allows workers and employers to calculate the heat index at worksites, displays a risk level, and gives reminders about safety measures that should be taken at that risk level.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA,&amp;nbsp;thousands of workers across the country suffer from serious heat-related illnesses, with labor-intensive activities in hot weather raising body temperatures above the level that can be cooled by sweating. Provide workers with &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/heat-stress-relief" target="_blank"&gt;heat stress relief products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and lightweight &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; to keep workers safe from the risk of heat-related illness and occupational hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on April 11, 2012, it had released its annual list of the metropolitan areas of the country that have built the most Energy Star certified buildings based on 2011 data.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The list of 25 cities is topped by Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Houston, Dallas, Riverside, CA, and Boston. By the end of 2011, the nearly 16,500 Energy Star certified buildings throughout the country had helped save almost $2.3 billion annually on utility bills and prevented greenhouse gas emissions in an amount equal to the emissions of more than 1.5 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;More and more organizations are discovering the value of Energy Star as they work to cut costs and reduce their energy use,&amp;quot; said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. &amp;quot;This year marked the twentieth anniversary of the Energy Star program, and today Energy Star certified buildings in cities across America are helping to strengthen local economies and protect the planet for decades to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Employees building green homes and businesses&amp;nbsp;around the country face many of the same hazards present in the traditional construction industry. Protect construction workers by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Center for Construction Research and Training (CPWR) has posted &lt;a href="http://stopconstructionfalls.com/?page_id=4" target="_blank"&gt;two interactive maps&lt;/a&gt; to highlight the danger of falls among workers in the construction industry in an attempt to lower the annual rate of fatal accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One map shows U.S. construction fatalities across the U.S., while the other shows how many of these deaths within the industry were due to falls. The maps were published to call attention to the ways that can bring down the number of fatal falls that occur every year, which include planning, training, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The busy summer months in the construction industry are upon us, and now is the time to ensure that workers and employers understand what is required to prevent falls,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. &amp;ldquo;When working at heights, everyone needs to plan ahead to get the job done safely, provide the right equipment, and train workers to use the equipment safely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In support of their nationwide initiative to prevent falls at small residential construction sites, OSHA has created a new &lt;a href="http://www.osha.gov/stopfalls" target="_blank"&gt;fall prevention web page&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with detailed information in English and Spanish on fall protection standards. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) have also created a new &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/construction/stopfalls.html" target="_blank"&gt;stop falls page&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, as well as a &lt;a href="http://stopconstructionfalls.com" target="_blank"&gt;joint website on fall prevention&lt;/a&gt;, which will be maintained by the CPRW&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis announced on April 26, 2012, that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), in partnership with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is heading a new campaign to prevent fatal falls in the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The effort is meant to raise workers&amp;#39; awareness by providing life-saving information and resources about how to safely work on ladders, scaffolds, and roofs. In 2010, more than 10,000 workers in the construction industry were injured in falls from heights, while another 255 workers were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The best way to honor Workers&amp;#39; Memorial Day is to make sure that another family does not have to suffer the pain of losing a loved one because of preventable workplace injuries,&amp;quot; said Secretary Solis. &amp;quot;Falls are the most fatal out of all hazards in the construction industry, accounting for almost one in every three construction worker deaths. Our simple message is that safety pays, and falls cost.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The announcement was made at the Action Summit for Worker Safety and Health as one of multiple events honoring Workers&amp;#39; Memorial Day.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Prevent workers from being injured from falls by guarding every floor hole, providing a guard rail and toe-board around every elevated open sided platform, floor, or runway, and supplying appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation has provided $20 million in emergency funds to help Oregon, Alabama, and South Carolina cover the costs of repairing roads and bridges that have been damaged by intense storms and other natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Obama Administration is committed to helping communities return to normal after natural disasters &amp;ndash; and that includes ensuring that friends and neighbors can get where they need to go safely,&amp;quot; said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. &amp;quot;These recovery funds will help reimburse states that needed to restore damaged roads and bridges in the days and weeks after natural disasters.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The states will be reimbursed for all expenses related to fixing or replacing highways, bridges, and other roadway structures. Costs incurred by introducing detours, removing debris, and other immediate measures taken to restore traffic flow will also be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Disasters can leave communities immobile as local agencies are left with a huge mess to clean up and a price tag to match,&amp;quot; said Federal Highway Administrator Victor Mendez.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Protect highway and bridge workers from falls, caught betweens, and struck-by hazards by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Traffic-Safety-Vests" target="_blank"&gt;hi-visibility safety vests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded Carnegie Mellon&amp;rsquo;s College of Engineering and the University of Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s School of Engineering and Applied Science $3.5 million to be used over the next two years to research ways to improve the safety and efficiency of transportation&amp;nbsp;and to implement new technologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A national University Transportation Center (UTC) will be located at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. Through this new UTC, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pennsylvania will explore new technologies that could affect a wide range of transportation issues, from vehicle and road safety to analysis of traffic flow. The project will also establish a workforce development program that will train graduate students in modern transportation-related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;State-of-the-art computing and communication technologies can significantly advance the safety and efficiency of transportation, since extending the physical infrastructure is both very expensive and limited by existing road layouts,&amp;quot; said Raj Rajkumar, the George Westinghouse Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As more projects to improve the safety of roadways and transportation efficiency begin, ensure workers use appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for highway work zones.&amp;nbsp;Protective equipment can include &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Traffic-Safety-Vests" target="_blank"&gt;hi-vis vests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced in early May, 2012, that it had finished cleanup of the Cold War legacy transuranic (TRU) waste at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The last four shipments of remote-handled (RH) TRU waste from the site was delivered to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) outside Carlsbad for permanent disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The project, which was a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), was a milestone for the DOE Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO). Under the ARRA, the process was expedited to support the DOE&amp;#39;s goal to remove and dispose of 90 percent of the Hazard Class 7 Radioactive waste by 2015, four years after the project began in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An important component of the Department&amp;rsquo;s ARRA investment was to focus on waste removal from small quantity sites at locations around the country where a comparatively small amount of legacy TRU waste was present,&amp;quot; said senior advisor for environmental management David Huizenga. &amp;quot;With this last shipment of RH TRU waste from Sandia, we&amp;rsquo;ve now achieved goals to remove legacy TRU waste from eight small quantity sites with ARRA funds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All employers operating in hazardous waste cleanup projects in the U.S. must follow the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&amp;#39;s (OSHA&amp;#39;s) hazardous waste cleanup regulations, which include assessment, planning, worker training, and the use of proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as specialized protective clothing, positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respiratory protection, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt; decontamination equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced it has deployed nearly 1,200 fuel cells in emergency backup power units and material handling equipment over the last three years&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Targeted investment in critical fuel cell research, development, and deployment will help spur American ingenuity and increase our competitiveness in the global clean energy economy,&amp;quot; said Dr. David Danielson, the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. &amp;quot;Fuel cells are an important part of our energy portfolio and these deployments in early markets are helping to drive innovations in fuel cell technologies across multiple applications.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;More companies are installing fuel cell technology to generate power for buildings, or to use as an emergency power supply for data centers and cell phone towers. Already, nearly 700 fuel cells have been installed to provide backup power using $18.5 million in funding from the Recovery Act. Another $9.7 million in funds has been used for over 500 fuel cell powered lift trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Workers installing fuel cells are exposed to a number of hazards, including freeze burns, fires, explosions, and electrical. Protect workers from these hazards by supplying appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/protective-clothing" target="_blank"&gt;protective clothing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) has released a checklist to address the growing concern over indoor environmental hazards. The checklist was written to help protect the health and safety of workers, workplaces, and environments, and focuses on asbestos, lead, combustion gases, chemicals, and other indoor hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;With more people spending a majority of their time indoors, whether at work or at home, they are increasingly exposed to indoor hazards. These dangers can be eliminated or controlled if the appropriate safety measures are taken.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ACOEM&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.acoem.org/uploadedFiles/Public_Affairs/Policies_And_Position_Statements/Guidelines/Library_and_Reference_Material/Earth%20Day%20CheckList%202012.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;environmental checklist&lt;/a&gt; provides 10 practical steps that all of us can take to improve the quality of our indoor environment,&amp;quot; said Dr. Robert K. McLellan, author of the checklist. &amp;quot;Earth Day reminds us of an ancient wisdom &amp;mdash; people are inextricably linked with their environment. The environment does not stop at the walls of our homes and buildings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets enforceable permissible exposure limits (PELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous airborne substances, and requires the use of appropriate personal protective equipment to keep workers safe. Protect workers from these indoor working hazards by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including protective clothing and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/respiratory-protection" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory protection&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced on April 19, 2012, that it had renewed an alliance with the Roadway Work Zone Safety and Health Partners to increase protection of workers in roadway construction work zones.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The alliance will focus on preventing worker injuries and fatalities from construction vehicle runovers, backovers, and other site-specific hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most fatalities that occur in road construction work zones involve a worker being struck by a piece of construction equipment or other vehicle,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health David Michaels. &amp;quot;This renewed alliance with the Roadway Work Zone Safety and Health Partners will help reach workers and employers with critical education and information to reduce preventable injuries and deaths.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The two-year agreement will help the alliance create fact sheets for paramedics, police officers, truck drivers, and other work-zone visitors on the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and high-visibility garments to wear, and how to appropriately enter and exit work zones at different times throughout the day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Roadway employees are exposed to a number of hazards in highway work zones, including falls, electrical, struck-by, and caught-between dangers. Provide workers with appropriate safety products, such as high visibility vests, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and ensure traffic cones, reflectors, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; is in place in all work zones.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHA) in partnership with the International Fire Service Training Association (IFSTA) have updated the 2008 edition of the Traffic Incident Management Systems (TIMS) manual based on the results of a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The survey analyzed current traffic incident management practices and policies, giving the 2012 edition of the manual the most up-to-date technical information and training programs in traffic incident management for emergency responders.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Effective traffic incident management can enhance roadway safety for firefighters and other emergency responders of which too many have been killed on duty from being struck by vehicles,&amp;quot; said U.S. Fire Administrator Ernest Mitchell. &amp;quot;The USFA was pleased to work with the DOT Federal Highway Administration and IFSTA towards reducing this number.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The study included research on effective roadway operations and safety, including roadway high-visibility safety vests and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, distancing of roadway warning signs, appropriate emergency vehicle warning lighting, and safety training.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re committed to enhancing the safety of firefighters and emergency responders working on our nation&amp;#39;s roadways,&amp;quot; said Victor Mendez, Federal Highway Administrator. &amp;quot;We must provide for the safety of these men and women who act selflessly to risk their lives to protect and assist the motoring public.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The new manual includes incident command and safety survival basics for roadway incidents, case studies of roadway incidents that have resulted in emergency responder fatalities, and examples of traffic incident management programs that have been effective.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) announced on April 26, 2012, that 29 candidates completed the Qualified Safety Sales Professional (QSSP) course on April 16-20 in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The course put the candidates through a rigorous week of training in technical and regulatory fundamentals for occupational safety and health. The 29 new QSSPs add to the more than 1,000 &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing and distributor personnel that have gained the designation since it first started in 1996. The program was originally sponsored by both ISEA and the Safety Equipment Distributors Association (SEDA), but is now completely in the hands of ISEA.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program strives to train marketing and sales professionals in the &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; industry to become a reliable source of information to customers by learning about the principles and practices of workplace health and safety. The course teaches about industry hygiene basics, risk management, safety engineering, workers&amp;#39; comp, and health and safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During training, students review a wide range of safety equipment, and learn how to implement these safety products, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, into their customers&amp;#39; operations to create a safe working environment.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Safety Council (NSC) released its estimates for the amount of car accidents that may occur over the Memorial Day weekend, which starts at 6 p.m. on Friday, May 24, and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, May 28.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The group says 420 traffic fatalities and 42,000 reported injuries are expected over the holiday, which signals the kickoff to summer and often sees parties and celebrations. The council also estimates 149 people could survive accidents because of proper seat belt use.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the last six years, the three-day weekend has averaged 11.5 percent more traffic fatalities than similar non-holiday periods, which is most likely due to higher travel activity.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;To keep the chance of having an accident to a minimum, the NSC recommends refraining from all cell phone use while driving, driving defensively and cautiously, and to avoid driving drowsy. A designated driver should always be used, as even moderate alcohol consumption impairs reaction time and driving abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All motorists should keep an accident kit in their vehicle in the event of a crash. The package should include reflective triangles, a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently issued a statement underscoring the importance finding shelter during a tornado and addressed using helmets as another potentially useful and effective protection measure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The CDC said that although no research exists to show that helmets can offer protection during tornadoes, head injuries are common causes of death during a tornado. But in order for any helmet to be effective, it must be as readily accessible as other &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because the time to react may be very short, people who choose to use helmets should know where they are and have them readily accessible. Looking for a helmet in the few seconds before a tornado hits may delay you getting safely to shelter,&amp;quot; the CDC warned.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Most helmets are constructed of lightweight plastic materials and may include bicycle or motorcycle helmets, sports or military styles, full brim or cap style &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and protective emergency services helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends creating an emergency supply kit to prepare for and respond to emergencies such as natural disasters. Effective emergency kits can include everyday supplies including food and water, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; such as dust masks, flashlights, and a &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/first-aid/first-aid-kits-supplies" class="dnautolink"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;On January 30, 2012, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced it had renewed its alliance with the American Pipeline Contractors Association (APCA) to continue protecting workers from dangerous job hazards during equipment operation, trenching and excavation, and hydrostatics testing.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As OSHA continues its Alliance with the American Pipeline Contractors Association, one of our goals is to ensure that appropriate precautions are taken to protect workers during pipeline construction for the oil and gas industry,&amp;quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health David Michaels. &amp;quot;We value APCA&amp;#39;s collaborative efforts to change the culture of pipeline industry workplaces so that employers and workers cooperate with a focus on prevention.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The two-year agreement will allow the alliance to share information on safety and health standards, worker rights, and employer responsibilities through forums, exhibits and stakeholder meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Excavating is known as one of the most hazardous construction operations. To confront this, OSHA has written several standards and directives related to the industry. Ensure these&amp;nbsp;standards are met by supplying the appropriate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Traffic+Safety+Supplies;q3=Traffic+Safety+Vests%2C+T+Shirts%2C+and+Sweatshirts;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;high-vis safety vests&lt;/a&gt; to keep workers safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) recently worked with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to sponsor the 10th annual &amp;lsquo;Safety-on-the-Job&amp;rsquo; poster contest for kids, giving 5-14 year-olds the opportunity to show what they know about occupational health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In the contest, over 2,500 children from the United States and 14 other countries, entered their drawings for the chance to have them made into a poster. The 10th annual contest was held to raise awareness of occupational safety and what can be done to prevent injuries and illnesses at work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The five first place winners and 15 runners-up were honored in Washington, D.C. at the North American Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH) kick-off events that took place on May 6-7, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;One winner, Abigail Helser, an 11-year-old from Madison, Alabama, depicted a worker wearing a number of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including a hard hat, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Safety-Glasses" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Ear-Plugs" class="dnautolink"&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt; and a high-visibility safety vest, with the caption &amp;quot;Safety Sam Wants YOU to be Safe too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The program &amp;quot;teaches children about the importance of being safe at work and educates them on what occupational safety, health, and environmental (SH&amp;amp;E) professionals do at work to protect people, property, and the environment,&amp;quot; ASSE stated.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), found 68 percent of highway contractors in the U.S. had motor vehicles crash into their work zones in the last 12 months. Officials from the organization added that the crashes were more likely to kill highway workers than the vehicle&amp;#39;s operators or passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any time your job site is just a few feet away from fast-moving traffic, things can get a little too exciting,&amp;quot; said Tom Brown, chair of the AGC&amp;rsquo;s national highway and transportation division. &amp;quot;Since construction workers don&amp;rsquo;t get the option of wearing seat belts, they are more likely to be killed in a work zone crash than motorists are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brown added that 28 percent of construction companies said their workers were injured in a work zone crash in the last year and 18 percent had at least one worker killed in a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Provide &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/safety-maintenance" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety equipment&lt;/a&gt; such as signs, cones, barrels, and barriers to help control traffic flow at your worksite. Ensure all employees working in high traffic areas wear appropriate work zone &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Search?i=1;q1=Safety+Maintenance;q2=Traffic+Safety+Supplies;q3=Traffic+Safety+Vests%2C+T+Shirts%2C+and+Sweatshirts;sp_pr=v2;x1=category-1;x2=category-2;x3=category-3" target="_blank"&gt;high-visibility safety vests&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for their work area and are equipped with the proper &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;In late April, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began a project to remove hazardous materials from a site in Danvers, Massachusetts. They expect the project to last for eight weeks, with additional investigation and potential cleanup operations possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The EPA&amp;#39;s belief that the site&amp;#39;s use across the 20th century as a leather tannery and finishing facility may have led to contamination of the property along the Crane River prompted an evaluation, which determined that arsenic in the surface soil still remains. The levels of arsenic are above the Imminent Hazard threshold, which represents a value that could put individuals at risk if they are exposed even for a relatively short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;EPA workers handling contaminated soils must be dressed in protective clothing as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has developed a number of standards for hazardous materials cleanup operations. In addition to standards on the use of &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt; and protective clothing, OSHA also requires appropriate training for all operations,&amp;nbsp;including the proper handling of hazardous materials. Ensure workers are wearing appropriate protection, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/respiratory-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;respiratory protection&lt;/a&gt;, gloves, boot covers, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/protective-clothing"&gt;protective clothing&lt;/a&gt; to lower the risk of contamination on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Purdue University&amp;#39;s Agricultural Safety and Health Program reported fatal and non-fatal grain entrapments dropped significantly to 27 cases in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Grain entrapment cases were down 47 percent compared to the year before, a major drop that has been attributed to greater enforcement and outreach from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In 2010, the annual study found that there were a record high 51 entrapments, which led to 26 fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Purdue experts say the decline comes amid OSHA&amp;#39;s tougher stance on grain entrapment and improved quality of stored grain, factors which have helped raise awareness and reduce the dangers of entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OSHA has made a significant commitment through the Susan Harwood Grant&amp;nbsp; program to support projects to develop new teaching strategies and resources designed to reduce the frequency and severity of flowing grain related incidents,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to OSHA, falls from height are a common hazard found in grain storage facilities that can result in grain entrapments. Protect workers from this hazard by providing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt; systems in grain handling operations.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Safety Council (NSC) announced on June 3 that it had launched its Employee Wellness week in celebration of National Safety Month, a time set aside every year to educate and encourage safe workplace behaviors that can prevent injuries and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The week-long awareness campaign will provide information for making better lifestyle decisions that could lower the risk for long-term illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, if people chose to eat healthier foods, be more active, reduce alcohol consumption, and quit smoking, more than 80 percent of all cases of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and at least one-third of cancers could be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The NSC provided a few tips for employers that will help ensure their workforce remains healthy, including:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;- encouraging brisk walks during lunch breaks&lt;br /&gt;
                - offer water, rather than sugary drinks&lt;br /&gt;
                - urge workers to join a gym or sports league&lt;br /&gt;
                - suggest making half their plate fruits and vegetables&lt;br /&gt;
                - recommend going for a bike ride after work&lt;br /&gt;
                - choosing lean sources of protein&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In addition to promoting better health, National Safety Month observance also addresses&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/ergonomics" target="_blank"&gt;ergonomics&lt;/a&gt; and preventing slips, trips, and falls. Ensure all workers are well trained and wearing appropriate &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety" class="dnautolink"&gt;safety products&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/foot-protection" target="_blank"&gt;foot protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Hard-Hats" class="dnautolink"&gt;hard hats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/fall-protection" class="dnautolink"&gt;fall protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently released a new document that outlines safe practices for working with engineered nanomaterials in labs and other settings.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories,&amp;quot; is a document that was developed to be used alongside established safe practices and current chemical hygiene plans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With the publication of this document, NIOSH hopes to raise awareness of the occupational safety and health practices that should be followed during the synthesis, characterization, and experimentation with engineered nanomaterials in a laboratory setting,&amp;quot; NIOSH wrote in the forward to the document. &amp;quot;The document contains recommendations on engineering controls and safe practices for handling engineered nanomaterials in laboratories and some pilot scale operations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Research shows that inhalation of nanomaterials is a significant route of exposure and&amp;nbsp;can interfere with lung function and in theory, the particles can enter the bloodstream from the lungs and inflict damage on other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the potential health effects of nanomaterials are still not fully understood, and further research is being conducted on the matter as part of a government-wide effort to assess the impact of nanomaterials on human health and the environment. Protect employees from the hazards of working with nanomaterials by providing &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/respiratory-protection" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory protection&lt;/a&gt;, impervious&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/Top-Products/Gloves" class="dnautolink"&gt;work gloves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="http://www.northernsafety.com/safety/personal-safety/protective-clothing" target="_blank"&gt;protective clothing&lt;/a&gt;, faceshields,&amp;nbsp;and other necessary personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
